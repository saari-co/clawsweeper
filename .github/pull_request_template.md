## What Problem This Solves

<!--
Describe the concrete user, product, or operational problem.
For fixes, begin with:
"Fixes an issue where users <do X> would <experience Y> when <condition>."
or:
"Resolves a problem where..."

Name the affected UI surface or workflow. Do not describe the code-level cause here.
-->

## Why This Change Was Made

<!--
In one or two sentences, explain the complete shipped solution, key design
decisions, and relevant boundaries or non-goals. Include implementation detail
only when it helps reviewers understand user-visible behavior or risk.
Avoid file-by-file narration.
-->

## User Impact

<!--
State what users, operators, or developers can now do or expect. Lead with the
concrete benefit and use user-facing language. If there is no user-visible
impact, say so plainly.
-->

## OpenClaw Bay Impact

<!--
For lifecycle/review-publication, queue/workflow, status/telemetry, or dashboard
data-contract changes, name the affected Bay surface and its proof. Otherwise,
state why Bay is unaffected. See AGENTS.md.
-->

## Documentation Impact

<!--
For every code, configuration, workflow, API, UI, package, policy, or integration
change, name the canonical documentation reviewed and summarize any required
updates. If no documentation changes are needed, explain why the existing
contract remains accurate.

For new or changed documentation, also classify it as active, proposed,
compatibility-only, or historical. Active runbooks and volatile references must
name their role owner, source of truth, verified scope/revision, and update
triggers. See CONTRIBUTING.md.
-->

## Evidence

<!--
Show the most useful proof that this change works. Screenshots, screencasts,
terminal output, focused tests, CI results, live observations, redacted logs,
and artifact links are all useful. Include before/after evidence for visual
changes when it clarifies the result.

Reviewers will inspect the code, tests, and CI. Use this section to make the
validation easy to understand, not to restate the diff.

For code-bearing changes, include the current `## Real Behavior Proof` package
described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). After review feedback, update
this main PR body and request a re-review only after the branch, proof, and body
are current.
