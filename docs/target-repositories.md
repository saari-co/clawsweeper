Read when enabling ClawSweeper for another OpenClaw repository, changing
`config/target-repositories.json`, or debugging `Unsupported target repo`
failures.

ClawSweeper has two target-repository paths:

- configured runtime profiles in `config/target-repositories.json`
- conservative generic fallbacks for exact event/manual reviews of configured
  owner inventories such as `openclaw/*` and `steipete/*`

Host-side installations may extend those runtime profiles without forking the
engine by setting `CLAWSWEEPER_REPOSITORY_PROFILE_OVERLAY` to an absolute path.
The exact-tuple producer reads tenant, engine-repository, actor, and artifact
prefix policy from a separate absolute overlay
(`CLAWSWEEPER_EXACT_TUPLE_CONFIG`). See
[Exact-tuple review producer](saari-exact-tuple.md). Do not bake those tenant
entries into `config/target-repositories.json`.
The JSON file uses the bundled `schema_version` and may contain only
`repositories` and `generic_fallbacks`. Entries are appended after strict
validation; an overlay cannot replace a bundled repository or owner fallback.
The overlay affects repository profile lookup and repair toolchain selection.
It does not alter the bundled target inventory, hosted admission registry,
dashboard targets, scheduled fanout, or apply membership.

`openclaw/openclaw` remains a built-in profile because it has broader
auto-close policy. Every other configured profile declares its own issue and PR
close rules in `apply_close_rules`; do not infer those rules from whether the
repository appears in the dashboard or receives scheduled work. The current
configured profiles allow `implemented_on_main` for issues and PRs, and some
profiles additionally allow age-gated `mostly_implemented_on_main` for PRs.

Review guidance belongs to the selected profile's `promptNote` in
`src/repository-profiles.ts` or `config/target-repositories.json`. The production
prompt assembler selects it with `repositoryProfileFor(item.repo)`, using the
normalized exact owner/repository, not the organization, display name, PR body,
linked repository, or author association. The built-in `openclaw/openclaw`
profile alone supplies its release-owned `CHANGELOG.md` review restriction.
`openclaw/clawsweeper`, ClawHub, and generic targets follow their own release-note
policies; being a non-core target does not grant contributors or workers
permission to edit release-owned files.

OpenClaw’s generated locale PRs are publisher-owned. Automatic apply and repair
close paths leave PRs open when live GitHub metadata identifies
`openclaw-mantis[bot]` as author, both head and base repositories as
`openclaw/openclaw`, base branch `main`, and head branch
`automation/native-app-locale-refresh` or `automation/control-ui-locale-refresh`.
GraphQL reports the same App author as `app/openclaw-mantis`. Titles and labels
do not grant this exemption, nor do matching branches in forks. The publisher
owns freshness reconciliation and auto-merge; this close guard grants no merge
authority and preserves normal review and CI requirements. Existing kept-open,
blocked, and skipped outcomes explain the decision, with no Bay schema or
control changes.

Toolchain and setup ownership is also per repository. The explicit
`openclaw/crabbox` profile selects npm and installs its nested worker package
with `npm ci --prefix worker` from the target root. It retains the generic
OpenClaw fallback's close rules, empty validation commands, and absent changed
gate; selecting target-native setup does not broaden apply policy or inherit
the core OpenClaw policy.

`openclaw/openclaw-enterprise` uses an explicit review-only profile. Its prompt
preserves the repository's platform-design, IAM, audit, persistence, deployment,
and integration-proof boundaries, while its baseline repair validation follows
the target repository's workspace, lint, formatting, OpenAPI, and typecheck
gates. Issue and pull-request close rules remain empty; enabling the target
dispatcher does not grant automatic close authority.

Repair validation defaults to 480,000 ms per command. Set `validation_timeout_ms`
in an exact repository entry (or `core_target_overrides`) to override it:
`openclaw/openclaw` uses 1,500,000 ms (25 minutes) for its cold changed gate.
Other repositories retain eight minutes. The repair workflow's optional
`target_validation_timeout_ms` input takes precedence over the ClawSweeper
repository variable `CLAWSWEEPER_FIX_TARGET_VALIDATION_TIMEOUT_MS`, then this
configuration, then the eight-minute default. Local executor calls use the
same environment variable. Blank or invalid values fall back to configuration.
Each top-level validation command receives a fresh budget. OpenClaw's
`pnpm check:changed` is one command whose internal typecheck, lint, and other
stages share that budget. The overall executor budget is the larger of 70 minutes
and 10 minutes of setup + the configured edit-worker budget + twice the validation
budget + 10 minutes for review/reporting, capped at 110 minutes. With the default
30-minute worker budget, OpenClaw receives 100 minutes. An explicit
`CLAWSWEEPER_FIX_STEP_TIMEOUT_MS` overrides that derivation within the existing
15-minute floor and new 110-minute ceiling. Actions resolves the same budget and
adds two minutes for executor shutdown; the job retains its 120-minute ceiling.
Checkout identity proof
reserves a small part of its budget. The lower-level
`CLAWSWEEPER_TARGET_VALIDATION_TIMEOUT_MS` can further shorten that budget.
The repair executor requests OpenClaw's `--timed` summary and records core
typecheck, core-test typecheck, and core lint durations in Actions logs, including
successful validation. Other command output is not echoed by this timing logger.

Edit, validation-fix, and review-fix workers run focused checks and return the
patch for one full executor acceptance pass. Worker claims and shell transcripts
are not acceptance receipts. The contained executor gate and checkout identity
checks remain required; a failed gate, subsequent edit, or final base synchronization
can require another pass. The doubled validation allowance covers such a repeat,
not a mandatory worker/executor duplicate.

On a confirmed timeout, the containment supervisor terminates and reaps the
command tree before the validator removes newly created OpenClaw ownership
directories (`.artifacts/dist-artifacts.lock` and `.artifacts/vitest-workers`).
Pre-existing ownership, unrelated artifacts, unsafe path replacements, and
unverified process completion retain the existing recovery and identity guards.
If post-timeout identity verification is inconclusive, the timeout remains the
primary diagnostic, both errors are retained, and the checkout requires recovery
before reuse. A proven checkout mutation still takes precedence.

Dashboard targets are configured separately with `TARGET_REPOS` in
`dashboard/wrangler.toml`. Scheduled target selection comes from
`target_inventory`, and apply-enabled targets use the dashboard's
`APPLY_TARGET_REPOS` and `APPLY_OPTIONAL_TARGET_REPOS`. A runtime profile alone
does not enable any of those surfaces.

`PUBLIC_BAY_REPOS` is a separate public-output allowlist for the minimal
repository/item reference cards shown by OpenClaw Bay and Overview. Add a
repository only after confirming that it is public and intended to be visible
on the unauthenticated dashboard. The Worker treats an absent or malformed
allowlist as empty. Membership does not authorize titles, URLs, queries,
failure data, opaque keys, credentials, tokens, or any private-repository data.

## Generic Fallbacks

The fallback lets a newly installed repository dispatch to ClawSweeper
without a TypeScript change. It is intentionally narrow:

- owner must be listed in `generic_fallbacks`
- repo name must match `allow_repo_name_pattern`
- denied repositories are rejected
- scheduled fanout is public-only unless a private state publication path exists
- auto-close policy comes from that owner fallback
- `live_test`, when present, is retained for compatibility with historical
  live-proof records and tooling; automatic review-time live proof is retired
- generic `openclaw/*` issues can auto-close only for
  `implemented_on_main`; PRs can auto-close for `implemented_on_main` or
  age-gated `mostly_implemented_on_main`
- `steipete/*` starts review/comment-only for issues and PRs
- scheduled dashboard/backfill rows are added only through target fanout

This is enough for event-driven review after the target repo has the dispatcher
workflow and GitHub App installation.

## Add One Repository

1. Install the ClawSweeper GitHub App on the target repository.
2. Add or merge the target dispatcher from
   [`docs/target-dispatcher.md`](target-dispatcher.md).
3. Ensure the target repo can read the org or repo
   `CLAWSWEEPER_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` secret.
4. Open, edit, or comment on a target issue/PR and confirm a dispatcher run
   appears in the target repo.
5. Confirm the receiver run appears in
   `https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions`.
6. Confirm the target item gets one durable ClawSweeper review comment.

Add a `config/target-repositories.json` entry when a repository needs explicit
review guidance, toolchain configuration, or close rules. Dashboard and
scheduled-queue membership are separate changes; update their owning
configuration only when that rollout is intended. Keep close rules narrow
unless the repository has a documented reason for broader policy.

## Add Many Repositories

Batch rollout should use target fanout:

- install the app and dispatcher on a small group first
- leave auto-close disabled unless the owner/repo profile explicitly enables it
- verify event review/comment sync on one issue or PR per repo
- use `pnpm run target-fanout -- plan --mode hot-intake --limit 10 --dry-run`
  to inspect the current owner inventory and selected dispatch commands
- let the scheduled fanout cursor dispatch small batches across
  `target_inventory.owners`; the cursor is stored in the authenticated
  ExactReviewQueue Durable Object rather than `clawsweeper-state`
- fanout passes each repository's default branch as `target_branch`, so repos
  that use `master` or another branch do not fall back to `main`
- add config entries only for repos that need repo-specific guidance or broader
  close policy

If a target dispatch reaches ClawSweeper but receiver token creation fails, the
App is usually not installed on that target repo. If the target workflow skips
before dispatch, the target repo usually cannot access
`CLAWSWEEPER_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
