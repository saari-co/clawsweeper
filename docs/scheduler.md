# Issue and PR Scheduler

- Status: active, volatile architecture and operations reference
- Owner: ClawSweeper maintainers
- Source of truth: `.github/workflows/sweep.yml`, planner/runtime source,
  `config/automation-limits.json`, and focused scheduler tests
- Last verified: `openclaw/clawsweeper@647503ec44b8e777dd172adf974a945367da0d19`
- Update when: cadence, fanout, admission, retry, publication, apply, or
  state-writing behavior changes

Read when changing `.github/workflows/sweep.yml`, `src/clawsweeper.ts` planner
selection, review cadence, dashboard capacity fields, or GitHub Actions
concurrency for issue/PR review and apply.

The global worker budget comes from `config/automation-limits.json`; see
[Automation Limits](limits.md) for the derived lane limits and GitHub variable
overrides.

Repair and automerge jobs also carry the canonical `job_intent` frontmatter
described in [ClawSweeper Orchestration](orchestration.md). Workflow inputs can
still override live-worker caps, but when they do not, `repair:dispatch` derives
the priority lane from `job_intent` instead of relying on workflow-specific
defaults.

Exact-review completion sends `review_failure_reason` for every diagnostics
manifest with `failure.stage: agent_input_scan` and `retryable: false`, using
`failure.reason_code` verbatim. The accepted scanner reasons are
`scanner_unavailable`, `scanner_failed`, `findings`, `deadline`, `staging_limit`,
`incomplete_source`, `source_drift`, `unsafe_path`, and `unsupported_content`;
`source_incompatible` remains a separate terminal source-preparation reason.
The shared allowlist lives in `src/exact-review-failure-reason.ts`. Exit codes
78 and 79 still identify `incomplete_source` and `findings` without a manifest.
A matching non-retryable `review_failure` detail is accepted; retryable or
mismatched detail is rejected. Diagnostic detail alone does not suppress retry:
without `review_failure_reason`, failed completion still retries. During Worker/workflow deploy skew, an HTTP 400
`invalid_review_failure_reason` response triggers one immediate compatibility
retry without the terminal reason or its dependent status receipt, preserving
`review_failure` diagnostic detail and emitting a workflow warning. An older
Worker can then complete the lease under its existing retry policy; compatible
Workers receive the terminal reason on the first request. Other errors retain
the existing failure and retry handling. Terminal completion does not turn the
failed workflow green. An automatic PR review with a recorded head SHA and `source_incompatible`
retains a parked queue item: the exact source pin cannot improve on that head,
so scheduled intake must not repeat its preparation. Scheduled PR intake binds
the live head, base, draft state, and body identity before dispatch takes its
lease snapshot. This state has no timed retry. Existing parked-item
reconciliation recovers changed head, base, or body
identity and removes closed targets; an explicit maintainer re-review can retry
unchanged source. The failure remains visible in lifecycle and Bay status.
Terminal input-scanner refusals instead retain the existing queue item as
`scanner_refused`, for both issues and PRs. Automatic events, source changes,
close/reopen, and failed-shard recovery cannot release this hold. It has no
timed retry, expiry, closed-target cleanup, or operator source-drift recovery.
A fresh verified re-review command or a newly dispatched explicit item request
replaces the failed request's authority. Verified command timestamps must be strictly
later than the refusal and failed command timestamps. GitHub timestamps have
second precision, so all same-second requests stay held regardless of origin or
comment ID; a new command or edit in a later second can retry.
Replaying an old command or workflow
run does not. The manual API also accepts named request IDs; use a new unique ID
for each explicit retry. The failed ID remains fenced on the held decision even
after delivery receipts expire. An intentional `EXACT_REVIEW_RETRY_POLICY_EPOCH` change permits
the next automatic admission without inheriting failed command context;
ordinary deployments, model changes, and prompt changes do not.

Untargeted workflow-dispatch sweeps, including automatic continuations, feed
the same queue as scheduled intake. Their branch, prompt, and timeout options
remain supported, but a broad sweep is not an explicit retry of every hold.
The hold applies to newly observed terminal refusals; previously deleted rows
are not reconstructed. Deploy Worker enforcement before relying on updated
producer routing. Already-running direct shards from older workflow revisions
remain a rollout limitation. Bay uses the terminal failure lifecycle rather
than displaying the retained hold as active review work; queue reason counts
remain visible and the public surface remains observer-only.

Native
blob-fetch transport failures, including the hydration deadline killing a Git
fetch, remain `source_preparation` / `review_blobs_unavailable` with
`retryable: true`. They enter the existing bounded retry schedule without a
terminal scanner reason. Every retry must still prepare complete input and
pass the canonical input scan; scanner refusals and staging limits remain
terminal until the explicit release described above.

Scheduled and manual explicit queue admissions use the same exact-event review
step. Aggregate shard recovery uses its per-item terminal ledger instead of
producing a queue-level `failure_reason` from the shard's process exit.
When a completed review has handed off to pending or active publication, a late
failed-shard recovery remains queued until publication settles or parks. Its
request is preserved because it may refer to a newer source. Explicit re-reviews, source
changes, and publication source-drift or artifact-retention recovery retain their
normal admission paths.
Bay continues to show the publication as the item's current work until that
handoff releases the deferred recovery.

ClawSweeper has three issue/PR scheduler paths:

- exact event review for one target issue or pull request
- hot intake for new or recently active queue edges
- normal backfill for due backlog review

The lanes share report storage and apply rules, but they intentionally do not
share throughput. Event review and hot intake keep new maintainer-visible work
fast. Manual normal backfill has a configured ceiling of 89 concurrent Codex
review shards within the 104 background slots available after reservations.
Scheduled hot intake and normal backfill share a 32-slot queue cap.
Manual normal review has an active floor of 38 requested shards: due items
win first, and if fewer than 38 items are due, the planner can fill from older
eligible reviews. The smaller worker allowance always wins. Scheduled planning
does not use this floor.

Scheduled reviews can reuse exact unchanged inputs through structural or
content caches. Changed PR content goes to Codex, including source comments
and formatting. See [Review Cache](review-cache.md) for admission, freshness,
and runtime packaging rules.

### Control-plane workflow retries

Shell calls to the control plane in `sweep.yml`, `exact-review-reconcile-run.yml`,
and `exact-review-dead-letter-reconcile.yml` use
`scripts/control-plane-curl.sh`. Each request retries connection failures and
HTTP 5xx up to four attempts. A valid `Retry-After` delay (seconds or HTTP-date)
is capped at 60 seconds; otherwise the waits are 2, 4, and 8 seconds. Each
attempt emits a notice. The helper preserves the caller's final curl exit code,
HTTP status output, and body handling. HTTP 4xx responses are not retried;
callers retain their explicit lease-conflict, supersession, and deployment-skew handling.
This includes enqueue, claims, review/status heartbeats, completion, lifecycle
receipts, terminal-finalization operations, reconciliation, and the DLQ health
probe. Existing typed batch clients retain their separate lease-aware retry
policy. Fence and reservation failures are attributed to the existing
`queue_completion_failure` infrastructure category, including a review that
never starts because its status fence is unavailable.

Before a job's source checkout, the workflow downloads this single helper from
`raw.githubusercontent.com`, pinned to `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and `GITHUB_SHA`,
with three curl retries into `RUNNER_TEMP`. The bootstrap fails if the download
fails, is empty, or does not define `control_plane_curl`. These steps source the
temporary copy; after the full checkout, steps source the repository copy.
Claimed-lease completion and terminal retry steps select the repository copy
only when the source checkout succeeded. They use the validated temporary copy
when checkout failed or was skipped, including direct-lifecycle recovery.
The bootstrap never changes workspace Git configuration: an early sparse
checkout can otherwise leave later checkouts sparse and omit local actions.

The terminal-run observer (`scripts/review-run-observer.mjs`) uses plain Node
after checkout and retries its telemetry POST up to three times. Each attempt
retains the 20-second deadline. Connection resets and other recognized transient
transport failures, timeouts, HTTP 408/429, and HTTP 5xx can retry; other HTTP
4xx responses and configuration or certificate failures remain terminal.
Fallback waits are one and two seconds. A valid `Retry-After` value (seconds or
HTTP-date) replaces that wait, capped at ten seconds, so publication has at most
60 seconds of request time and 20 seconds of backoff. GitHub job discovery is
unchanged and remains subject to the enclosing workflow timeout.

The observer serializes and signs once, then reuses those exact bytes. The
existing telemetry owner records the first `(run_id, run_attempt)` tuple and
ignores duplicates, including retries after a committed response is lost.
Responses are cancelled before retry. An acknowledged write whose response
cleanup fails is reported separately and is never replayed. Retry diagnostics
include the attempt, status or transport category, and delay; upstream response
bodies are not logged. Exhaustion remains a failed workflow. This improves
completeness of the existing review-observability data used by OpenClaw Bay;
its schema, observer-only UI, and mutation boundaries do not change.

## Workflow

Explicit `workflow_dispatch` `item_number`/`item_numbers` selections, excluding
`apply_existing`, use `src/repair/manual-review-enqueue.ts` before review. They
do not fall back to matrix publication. Admission is independently durable per
item; the CLI reports failed members and continues the requested tail. Retries
of the same workflow run reuse its run ID and item number, excluding attempt.
Changed payloads conflict rather than borrowing an earlier delivery receipt.
Admission preserves the resolved operator-selected `target_branch`; it discovers
the repository default only when no resolved branch was supplied. The resolved
`codex_timeout_ms` and one-off `additional_prompt` travel with that decision.
Manual timeouts honor the requested positive duration up to the existing exact-review
45-minute cap; ordinary adaptive timeout behavior is unchanged. Ordinary item
events may refresh source facts but cannot replace the selected branch, timeout,
or instructions. A new explicit manual request may replace those options or clear
its one-off instructions.

The queue advertises `manual_publication.policy=record_comment_only` and an
explicit enabled bit through signed `POST /internal/exact-review/admission-capabilities`.
The manual producer checks that contract before resolving items, independently
of the aggregate public dashboard. Admission defaults off until
`EXACT_REVIEW_MANUAL_PUBLICATION_ENABLED=1` is configured after the consumer
rollout described in [repair operations](repair/operations.md#manual-publication-rollout).
Manual decisions carry `sourceAction=manual_explicit_review` and immutable
`publicationPolicy=record_comment_only`. Their completed artifacts use existing
direct and batch publication capacity, fences, and retries. Source drift ends
as superseded; unusable artifacts exhaust publication retries into existing
dead letters instead of starting another model review. Temporary authority-service
transport failures and HTTP 429/5xx responses use the existing
`retryable_failure` / `state_contention` disposition and coordinator retry budget.
They never authorize a write, revive a lease, or enter GitHub's inline retry loop;
actual ownership/authentication rejection remains fail-closed.

Direct producers publish from the existing exact bundle's `review/` directory,
not raw `artifacts/event` output. `EXACT_REVIEW_PUBLICATION_ARTIFACT_DIR` selects
that input relative to `EXACT_REVIEW_WORK_ROOT`; other callers retain the
`artifacts/event` default. Snapshot capture and application use that same work
root even when the publisher is invoked from a separate code checkout. Relative
`EXACT_REVIEW_BATCH_MUTATION_OUTPUT` paths also resolve under the work root,
including refusals that happen before publication authority is accepted.
Producer `selection.json`, `codex/`, `review-trees/`, and sibling reports stay
outside the selected bundle. The importer still rejects
unexpected files, symlinks, and directories in its publication input.

Exact-item review jobs materialize the target with
`scripts/review-target-checkout.sh`. Its cache is a blobless bare repository
holding the target branch's full commit and tree history, the tags on that
history, and every blob of the branch tip. Actions cache keys are
`<target-slug>-review-target-git-v1-<os>-<branch>-<YYYYMMDD>-<HH>` (UTC). A run
restores the newest entry from the same UTC day, fetches only the branch delta
and the missing tip blobs, and clones the checkout locally with hardlinked
objects. The first run of each hour saves the refreshed cache right after
checkout, before any review input touches the workspace, and then deletes all
but the two newest entries for that target branch; the first run of each day
builds from GitHub again, which bounds pack and blob growth. Tip blobs fetched by
id are the slow part (about 250 blobs/s from GitHub), and `openclaw/openclaw`
changes roughly 7,800 tip blobs a day, which is why the cache is refreshed hourly
rather than daily. The checkout keeps the contract of a direct
`git clone --filter=blob:none --single-branch`: the branch at the current remote
head, full non-shallow history, branch tags, and a promisor `origin` for lazy
blob fetches. Cached tag refs are rebuilt through Git's normal tag auto-follow
on every warm fetch, so deleted or moved tags cannot survive in the checkout.
A non-fast-forward branch update rebuilds the cache so its old history cannot
retain tags outside the current branch. A failed or partial restore is discarded,
a failed cache fetch rebuilds the cache, and a failed local clone falls back to a clean clone without
saving. The pinned Codex source cache is keyed by the Codex version pinned in the
target checkout and is saved once per version.

The receiver workflow is `.github/workflows/sweep.yml`.

Important source files:

- `src/clawsweeper.ts`: item selection, cadence, planning, review, dashboard,
  and status JSON
- `config/target-repositories.json`: configured non-core target repositories
  and the conservative `openclaw/*` exact-review fallback
- `docs/target-repositories.md`: target onboarding and rollout checklist
- `src/repair/workflow-utils.ts`: GitHub Actions output shaping for plans
- `results/sweep-status/<repo-slug>.json`: Git-backed operational state consumed
  by the dashboard
- `records/<repo-slug>/items/<number>.md`: open item reports in the canonical
  Worker store
- `records/<repo-slug>/closed/<number>.md`: archived item reports in the
  canonical Worker store

The canonical Worker owns `records/**`, while R2 owns `ledger/v1/**` and
`assets/**`. The `state` branch of `openclaw/clawsweeper-state` retains only the
operational `jobs/**`, `results/**`, `notifications/**`, and apply-report paths.
See [State storage](state-storage.md) for the ownership boundary and local
hydration commands.

Broad normal and hot review workflows use run-scoped concurrency groups, so a
new wave can overlap an older wave that has reached its long-tail or publish
phase. Their plan jobs use a separate concurrency group per target repository
with `cancel-in-progress: false`, serializing capacity decisions before each
matrix expands. The default single-pending policy coalesces superseded planner
ticks instead of retaining an unbounded history. Exact-item planners keep a
run-scoped group and do not wait for broad background planning.
Manual exact-item `workflow_dispatch` reviews use an exact-item concurrency
group with the same single-pending policy, so newer revisions replace stale
pending work instead of building a duplicate queue. Durable exact-review leases
use lease-scoped workflow groups and remain owned by the Worker admission lane.
If a successful exact-review run loses its completion callback, reconciliation
uses the saved lease's accepted or deduplicated direct-publication receipt and
requeue plan to preserve one owed source-drift review. The terminal `requeue`
disposition is recorded before completion and stays on the old fenced revision.
A superseded receipt cannot authorize a requeue; a newer command keeps its
current decision and revision through the ordinary finishing path.
The terminal-run backstop retains its `*/15 * * * *` schedule. Event-triggered
lease repair uses the reusable `exact-review-reconcile-run.yml` job with the
`exact-review-reconcile-workflow-run` concurrency group and
`cancel-in-progress: false`: one running job and one pending follow-up, with
new events replacing superseded pending jobs. The lock covers both the cooldown
check and reconciliation. Per-run reliability observations remain separate so
coalescing does not drop telemetry; eligible events still create observer jobs.

Before event repair, `scripts/exact-review-reconcile-guard.mjs` reads the latest
30 runs of `exact-review-reconcile.yml` using
`gh run list --json databaseId,updatedAt`. For runs updated within five minutes,
`gh run view --json jobs` verifies that a lease-reconciliation job actually
succeeded within that window, even if its observer job is still running.
Observer-only runs, skipped repairs, and failed repairs do not extend the
cooldown. A job-level output guard skips repair after a recent
success; unavailable history or the 60-second aggregate history-read deadline
allows repair to proceed. Each lookup is bounded by the remaining deadline,
and a successful result is checked for freshness after the read. Scheduled and
manual sweeps bypass the guard and inspect all claimed runs, so a terminal attempt
whose event was coalesced or skipped is normally reconciled within about
15 minutes worst case, plus Actions scheduling and execution delay. This is a
cadence backstop, not a hard wall-clock guarantee during platform outages.
OpenClaw Bay is unaffected: queue schemas, telemetry observations, and public
observer data contracts do not change.

Queue-completion failures remain visible separately from Codex or content
failures, using the logical generation result and typed deferral rather than
the review process exit alone. The workflow failure gate is unchanged.
Caught Codex failures in an exact-review job also upload a separate 14-day
diagnostic artifact while the runner remains alive. Its `error.txt`,
`stdout.error.txt`, and `stderr.tail.txt` files are sanitized for repository
readers and total at most 24 KiB with the readiness `manifest.json`. The
manifest retains a bounded failure stage, reason code, and the queue's computed
retryability even when unsafe raw detail is omitted. Raw
reports, unstructured stdout, and non-error prompt events are omitted. It is
never a publication input; cancellation, runner loss, or job termination can
still prevent upload. OpenClaw Bay and queue schemas are unchanged.

Recoverable parked reviews use the nominal 5/10/20-minute retry ladder, but
each item persists a schedule-time uniform jitter of 0.75-1.5x for every rung.
After the third automatic recovery, operator-only HMAC-signed routes provide a
bounded parked-review inventory and guarded resolution/fresh-recovery path. The
five-minute dead-letter reconcile workflow inspects at most 100 parked targets,
resolves terminal or repository-gone targets with an audit note, and can queue
at most five fresh reviews with replay-safe recovery keys. A fresh review now
requires a changed source action, head, base, draft state, body/content revision, fallback
source timestamp when no content digest exists, or retry policy epoch; a queue
revision by itself cannot reset the budget. Bump
`EXACT_REVIEW_RETRY_POLICY_EPOCH` when a scanner, policy, or deployment change
should reopen unchanged inputs. Manual workflow dispatches may explicitly opt
into `force_unchanged` for a bounded operator override. Manual runs remain
read-only unless `execute` is enabled; scheduled runs execute. Their sanitized
parked inventory is uploaded beside the publication dead-letter inventory.
Parked records carrying maintainer-command context remain visible with an
exclusion reason but cannot be resolved or fresh-recovered by this background
reconciliation path.
Publication dead letters whose recorded pull-request head no longer matches the
live head are never replayed or resolved from head drift alone. The reconciler
may resolve them as superseded only when the existing HMAC-authenticated
canonical-record read for the same target contains a complete review at that
live head, then rechecks the same open GitHub node and head immediately before
the guarded resolution. Each cycle checks at most ten such targets and resolves at most 20
rows per target; missing or mismatched evidence remains open as
`head_mismatch_unproven`. `tuple_protocol_invalid` and `workflow_cancelled`
rows are excluded from this path. Executed resolutions retain an audit note
with the newer head and canonical endpoint and increment the publication
completed and superseded totals; dry runs perform no mutation.
This drains the existing queue state and does not add a dashboard health input
or an OpenClaw Bay action: Bay remains observer-only.
GitHub throttle deferrals use the same per-item jitter band when the queue turns
the reported cooldown into its next-attempt timestamp, preventing a parked
cohort from becoming eligible in lockstep; coordination and ordinary failure
retries keep their existing timing.
Exact publishers complete as superseded when apply verifies one trusted, complete,
strictly newer durable review tuple for the same revision. The verified result
travels as structured apply evidence; reason text is diagnostic only. Ambiguous
or mixed results cannot terminalize the artifact, and legacy tupleless artifacts
retain the existing fresh-review path.

Legacy protocol-v1 review leases without lifecycle admission rows complete without
writing lifecycle facts. Once a completion commits its queue transition, alarm
scheduling runs even if the subsequent lifecycle update fails, so persisted
retries retain their scheduled wake-up.

Review publication and apply/comment sync use separate non-dropping queues.
Queue and GitHub App requests retain their request deadline through response-body
consumption. A stalled successful response becomes a typed timeout; an error
response retains its HTTP status and rate-limit headers even if its body stalls.
Apply treats a typed GitHub installation or abuse-rate-limit response as a
bounded yield, not a failed scan. It checkpoints completed item work, records
the interrupted item as `skipped_runtime_budget`, returns that item to the
cursor, and exits successfully so a later scheduled or continuation cycle can
retry it. This applies to comment-only sync and close-mode apply. Folder
reconciliation also defers before mutation when its open-item scan is
rate-limited; ordinary non-rate-limit failures remain fatal.
The source fallback publication minimum, base, and maximum are 4, 24, and 48,
but production overrides them to 8, 32, and 32, independently of the larger
80-review ceiling. The adaptive controller
classifies GitHub pressure:
a 403/429 or
explicit rate-limit failure records a 15-minute cooldown, while GitHub 5xx
failures record a 5-minute cooldown. Demand and recovery signals scale effective
capacity within the production range. Production batch
preparation is enabled for up to 8 concurrent size-8 batches, including 2
fresh-lane members per batch. Direct publication is also enabled and falls back
to the retry/batch path when the direct result is retryable. Apply/comment sync
remains per-target serialized. See [`docs/limits.md`](limits.md) for effective values and
[`docs/live-dashboard.md`](live-dashboard.md) for the public lane telemetry.
Tuple-aware state reconciliation prevents stale review snapshots from reviving
closed records.

Batch admission is additionally gated by persisted GitHub credential circuits.
Every batch needs the `actions:openclaw/clawsweeper` pool for producer artifact
download, while target App circuits are owner-scoped so one exhausted
installation does not stop healthy owners. A blocked pool prevents workflow
dispatch, state hydration, and artifact download for each matching member until
its reset-plus-deterministic-jitter recovery boundary; the alarm wakes at the
earliest pending member boundary. The current batch collapses after the first
pool failure, and unattempted members return without advancing their retry
budget. Recovery is staggered rather than released as one cohort.
An owner-scoped target App circuit also defers new exact-review admission for
that owner, because review and publication share the installation quota; other
owners remain admissible.
Legacy dispatches normally carry the event repository's validated default
branch. If an older producer omits it, intake creates a durable pre-admission
branch-authority reservation instead of spending the workflow repository's
Actions quota or assuming `main`. Resolution and direct-webhook source-head
verification both consult and update the same owner-scoped target App circuit:
the first quota response preserves its reset deadline, later same-owner
reservations defer without another read or attempt charge, and reset recovery is
bounded by the Durable Object alarm processor.

Exact publication routes only classifier-approved public reads through the
repository Actions token. If that pool is exhausted after the current member's
artifact is already present, the member may use the ambient target App once;
later members still stop because they require the blocked Actions pool. The
workflow also records a typed repository-pool observation if its final comment
router dispatch encounters quota pressure. All typed observations and request
counters are acknowledged with the same fenced batch completion, so a delayed
cleanup is idempotent and cannot duplicate accounting.

## Schedules

`openclaw/openclaw`:

- hot intake: `*/5 * * * *`
- normal backfill: `1 * * * *`
- apply: `3,18,33,48 * * * *`
- audit: `7 */6 * * *`

`openclaw/clawhub`:

- hot intake: `2/5 * * * *`
- normal backfill: `22 * * * *`
- apply: `8,23,38,53 * * * *`
- audit: `12 */6 * * *`
- review and apply work is gated by `CLAWSWEEPER_ENABLE_CLAWHUB=1`

`openclaw/clawsweeper`:

- audit: `17 */6 * * *`
- self-review is primarily manual or event-driven; scheduled audit keeps the
  dashboard health row fresh

Failed Codex review backstop:

- failed-review retry: `13 * * * *`
- retries remain dry-run unless `CLAWSWEEPER_FAILED_REVIEW_RETRY_ENABLED=1`
- each retry is exact-item, cooldown- and attempt-bounded, and complements the
  immediate one-shot failed-shard recovery in the originating workflow

`openclaw/fs-safe`:

- exact event review: enabled through the target repository dispatcher
- scheduled review/apply/audit: not enabled yet
- issues and PRs may auto-close only when already implemented on `main`

Generic `openclaw/*` and `steipete/*` repositories:

- exact event/manual review: supported through configured generic fallbacks after
  the target dispatcher and GitHub App installation are present
- scheduled review/audit: target fanout dispatches small cursor-based batches
  from `target_inventory.owners`
- private and internal targets: local maintainer review only, using an
  operator-provided checkout
- generic OpenClaw issues may auto-close only when already implemented on the
  default branch; generic OpenClaw PRs may additionally use age-gated mostly
  implemented there
- generic `steipete/*` repositories are review/comment-only for issues and PRs

Manual `workflow_dispatch` supports `target_repo`, `target_branch`, `item_number`,
`item_numbers`, `codex_timeout_ms`, `additional_prompt`, and `hot_intake`. Explicit
item selections use manual queue admission; broad runs offer due candidates to
shared queue limits. Per-run `batch_size`, `shard_count`, `apply_after_review`,
and its reason/age sub-options are retired. Existing callers must stop sending
those inputs; there is no silent compatibility alias. Apply remains available
through the separate `apply_existing` lane and its existing apply controls.

Target fanout dispatches review batches through `repository_dispatch` so each
selected repository can carry its inventory default branch without consuming
manual workflow inputs. Scheduled fanout uses:

- hot intake: `4/20 * * * *`, 20 target repositories per cursor step. This
  20-minute cadence is temporary containment for scheduled self-feedback;
  restore a faster cadence only after the loop is fixed and quota telemetry
  confirms it is safe. [PR #959](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/pull/959)
  intentionally moved this selector from every 15 minutes to every 5 minutes;
  this containment adjusts that current cadence without attributing the
  self-feedback defect to PR #959.
- normal review: `41 * * * *`, 12 target repositories per cursor step
- audit: `37 */6 * * *`, 12 target repositories per cursor step

Audit fanout keeps at most 3 target audits in flight using
`audit.max_parallel_targets` from `config/automation-limits.json`. It dispatches
bounded waves and waits for every acknowledged run in a wave to become terminal
before dispatching the next, including when a target fails or is cancelled.
The dispatch API returns exact run IDs (`return_run_details=true`); a missing
receipt, exhausted lookup retries, or 55-minute wave timeout stops further
dispatch. The existing signed audit cursor stores remaining targets and
outstanding run IDs after each dispatch and completion. The next invocation
resumes that batch and drains the saved children before admitting another wave.
Transient lookup errors retry twice with one- and two-second backoff. Audit
dispatch requires available durable state; an unresolved dispatch receipt stays
marked for operator investigation rather than freeing its slot. Run status is
read once per minute. Coverage inventory tokens are minted again after the waves,
immediately before the trailing coverage summary. The fanout job
allows four hours for the twelve-target batch; ordinary review/hot fanout keeps
its 30-minute timeout. The six-hour cadence, cursor selection, and twelve targets
are unchanged. This bound covers the scheduled fleet fanout, not separate manual
audits or the three dedicated core-repository audit schedules.

[PR #1007](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/pull/1007) is directly
relevant but was insufficient for the observed `openclaw/libterminal#41`
path. It was intended to recognize structurally proven ClawSweeper-owned
comment or label activity while keeping timestamp-only or incomplete evidence
eligible for conservative structural verification. Its mainline commit
`b83f2983da` predates and is an ancestor of the ClawSweeper head used by
[run 31336140651](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/31336140651).
That later scheduled run still reported one structural-cache check, zero
structural-cache hits, and one full hydration before publishing the durable
comment again. The evidence therefore shows that #1007 did not suppress this
specific execution path; it does not prove whether the receipt was missing,
incomplete, stale, or bypassed at admission, and it does not make #1007 the
cause of the loop. The temporary cadence reduction bounds demand while that
remaining path is corrected.

There is no ClawSweeper PR #1032: the relevant record is
[issue #1032](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/issues/1032), which
reported a post-#1007 review storm and was closed by
[PR #1036](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/pull/1036). PR #1036 changed
the exact-review workflow and review-preparation boundary to forward
`sourceAction` and classify `scheduled_hot_intake` and
`scheduled_normal_backfill` as automatic, making them eligible for receipt and
cache reuse instead of treating queued item numbers as explicit reviews. Its
merge commit `138ee2f96e` predates and is an ancestor of run 31336140651. The
run log contains `--review-source-action scheduled_hot_intake`, so #1036 was
effective at the classification boundary and was not bypassed there. The same
run nevertheless recorded zero structural-cache hits and one full hydration,
making #1036 a partial but insufficient mitigation for this case: it opened the
cache-eligible path, while the available structural receipt still failed to
match. This evidence does not attribute the remaining receipt mismatch to
#1036 itself.

Each mode's cursor lives in the authenticated ExactReviewQueue Durable Object,
not generated Git state. Reads and writes use a monotonic revision. If the
canonical cursor endpoint is unavailable, normal and hot fanout warn and
continue dispatch from a default cursor; persistence failure after dispatch
does not fail those lanes. Audit fanout requires a batch-aware cursor store and
stops on state failures so outstanding children cannot be forgotten.

Normal fanout refreshes the same signed live-open inventory consumed by
`GET /api/review-coverage`, and both normal and hot fanout skip repositories
with no open items. Normal fanout reserves a rotating slot for every selected
repository, keeps the largest untracked backlog in each cycle, and apportions
the remaining candidate volume by backlog share. The rotating slice is
dispatched first, so one large repository can fill otherwise-idle capacity
without permanently consuming smaller repositories' scheduled-feed budget.

Worker hydration also records the exact item identities present in the modern
canonical tuple store. Normal fanout and each target planner use those identities
for the same `untracked_open` boundary as the coverage endpoint. A hydrated
legacy backfill report remains review context, but it does not count as coverage
or yield a planner slot to a canonical re-review until a modern tuple exists.

The six-hour audit fanout also writes a GitHub Actions summary with canonical
open-item reports reviewed in the trailing seven days versus batched live open
issue and PR totals across the complete dynamic inventory.

Exact event review also starts Codex before generated-state hydration. The
single-item review only needs the target repository and live GitHub item state;
generated state is checked out afterward, just before publishing the review
record, safe close result, and command-router ledger.

Default close-mode apply refreshes use that same queue-only intake. The merged
apply report selects at most five distinct source-drift items in report order,
with unverified-checkout holds filling spare slots. The producer resolves the
repository default branch and each selected item's kind with narrow GitHub
reads, then sends `clawsweeper_item` with `source_action: source_drift_requeue`
and `supersedes_in_progress: false`. It does not send `clawsweeper_target_sweep`,
run a broad planner, or hydrate canonical repository records before enqueue.
Read or dispatch failures remain visible step failures; a dispatch notice is
not a durable admission receipt. The existing intake signs the queue request.

`source_drift_requeue` uses the queue's existing low-priority recovery contract:
existing pending or leased work, including maintainer-command context and source
authority, wins; delivery deduplication, pending backpressure, and lease fencing
remain queue-owned. Exact selection requests a fresh review of current source
without a new `force` flag, stale source pin, or producer-supplied lease. Closed
or missing targets still stop at the queue/executor live-state checks. General
manual and broad dispatch behavior, the independent proof cursor, and close
policy are unchanged. OpenClaw Bay needs no change: this producer reuses existing
queue/lifecycle fields and adds no published schema, status field, or control.

Exact PR review marks ClawSweeper's own acknowledgement comment
(`clawsweeper-pr-ack`) complete after the review snapshot and before direct
publication, and GitHub moves the PR's `updated_at` for that edit. Apply
freshness treats that edit as automation-only only when it is the item's latest
update and the review's complete source, timeline, PR head, and review-activity
receipt still matches the live item. Any other change in the window, including
a human comment, title/body or non-managed label edit, PR review, or new head,
still records `skipped_changed_since_review` and requeues a fresh
`source_drift_requeue` review. Without this allowance, a close proposal's own
status edit made every review drift and requeue indefinitely.

## Automerge Fast Path

Automerge is an exact-item event path. A maintainer command dispatches one
review for the current PR head. If review requests a repair, the adopted repair
worker may push a branch fix; after a successful contributor-branch repair it
immediately dispatches another exact-head review and then shepherds the repaired
head for a bounded window instead of exiting immediately. That keeps the normal
path to:

1. command acknowledgement;
2. exact-head review;
3. optional branch repair;
4. immediate exact-head re-review;
5. merge after checks, review verdict, and policy gates pass.

The complete state machine is documented in
[`docs/repair/automerge-flow.md`](repair/automerge-flow.md). Keep this section
as the scheduler-facing summary.

The automerge status comment is the live progress surface. It is edited in
place and records review, repair, re-review, and merge events with durations,
run links, and commit links.

If a no-op automerge repair finds that the PR was already the canonical fix, the
worker does not stop at the observational result. It immediately continues the
state machine: either queueing a fresh exact-head review, or, when the existing
ClawSweeper review only asked a maintainer to land the canonical PR and the
maintainer already opted into automerge, queueing the merge gate for that exact
review comment.

Automerge activation also checks the OpenClaw changelog policy before spending
an exact-head review pass. User-facing `fix`, `feat`, and `perf` PRs that touch
non-doc/test files and do not already include `CHANGELOG.md` go straight to the
adopted repair worker, so the changelog fix happens in the first loop instead
of being discovered only at the final merge gate.

After live hydration, adopted automerge/autofix repairs now skip the read-only
Codex planning pass entirely. The worker emits a generic structured fix
artifact directly: repair the contributor branch, rebase onto current `main`,
address comments/review findings/failing checks, add a changelog entry when
required, and validate. The execute stage still owns all GitHub mutations,
validation authority, push, exact-head review, checks, and merge gating.

For explicit base-sync-only repairs, the repair executor first tries a
deterministic fast path: rebase onto current `main`, apply known mechanical
conflict resolvers such as isolated `CHANGELOG.md` conflicts and generated
config checksum three-way conflicts, push the repaired branch, then wait for
exact-head review and GitHub checks. For substantive automerge repairs, Codex
owns the initial rebase plus PR-comment, CI, and local-test repair loop; the
executor still owns every GitHub mutation and reruns the normalized validation
gate before push. If `main` moves during that final validation, the worker does
one final base sync by default and lets the immediate exact-head review plus
GitHub checks validate the pushed head; `CLAWSWEEPER_FINAL_BASE_SYNC_ATTEMPTS`
can raise that only when extra local passes are intentionally worth the delay.
Likewise, the last internal Codex `/review` is not a dead end: if it still finds
an actionable issue, the worker can run one final review-fix pass, require
changed-surface validation to pass, push the repaired branch, and leave the
immediate exact-head review plus GitHub checks as the merge authority.
The default shepherd wait is ten minutes with 15-second polls, controlled by
`CLAWSWEEPER_AUTOMERGE_SHEPHERD_WAIT_MS` and
`CLAWSWEEPER_AUTOMERGE_SHEPHERD_POLL_MS`. Terminal check failures stop the
shepherd wait immediately and dispatch the router so the failed-check repair
loop can start without waiting for the full timeout.

The final router gate waits up to ten minutes for transient GitHub merge state
or pending required checks, polling every 15 seconds. Pending checks are wait
states, not repair triggers; terminal required-check failures can still dispatch
the adopted repair worker. If GitHub still reports `UNSTABLE`, ClawSweeper
allows the merge command to try when the only visible blockers are ignored
non-gating automation checks such as `ClawSweeper Dispatch`; GitHub branch
protection still enforces required checks at merge time. If the live merge
preflight reports `DIRTY`, `BEHIND`, or `CONFLICTING`, automerge treats that as
repairable rebase work and dispatches the adopted repair worker instead of
leaving the PR open with only a status comment.

## Capacity

The exact-review queue owns hosted review concurrency and retry authority. Each
admitted item runs one Codex session. Planners select candidates; they neither
reserve a matrix of workers nor publish review results.

Repair and explicit item work retain their existing priority. Broad manual and
scheduled intake share the queue's background capacity and pacing; see
[`docs/limits.md`](limits.md) for the configured budgets.

Current defaults:

- exact event review: 1 shard, 1 item
- exact manual hot intake: 1 shard, 1 item
- scheduled hot intake and normal backfill: size candidate selection from live
  queue-advertised capacity, with normal fanout sharing that budget across its
  selected targets. If the capacity probe is unavailable, a direct single-target
  schedule falls back to 50 candidates; normal fanout creates a pool of 50
  candidates per selected target and apportions that pool by backlog. Each
  selected item enters the durable exact-review queue, and every admitted item
  receives its own parallel workflow
- total review admission target: 60 items/hour across the fleet; organic work
  consumes the budget first and scheduled backfill fills the remainder, split
  35% hot intake and 65% normal backfill, with a 6-item burst and at most 32
  scheduled reviews dispatching or leased across both lanes
- review admission and pressure are computed independently from publication;
  top-level queue health describes reviews while `lanes.publication` retains
  publication backlog, retry, DLQ, and health telemetry
- fleet fanout: 20 hot targets every 20 minutes as temporary self-feedback
  containment, and 12 normal targets hourly;
  each target cycle can offer up to 50 due items to the shared admission budget
- broad manual runs use the same queue capacity as scheduled feeds; normal
  planning scans at most 250 GitHub pages and hot intake at most 10

The shared hard cap bounds each candidate offer. A target-fanout allocation may
reduce that offer, but it is not a per-run worker count. Each planner uses one
logical partition with no active-floor backfill, then ends after admission.
Periodic schedules and the existing apply-lane backstop provide later intake;
there is no matrix runtime archive, aggregate publisher, or recursive review
continuation.

Broad planning does not use the active-floor backfill. It selects only due
items, records each candidate's previous-review age in `plan.json`, and writes a
run-summary funnel for selected, attempted, enqueued, deduped, shed, and deferred
items. The public queue projection exposes the configured rate and replay
contract under `scheduled_feed` in `GET /api/exact-review-queue`; private bucket
balances are omitted. Queue telemetry distinguishes backpressure from
scheduled-rate shedding so an operator can distinguish a full review queue
from intentional 60/hour pacing. The
six-item burst bounds a cold-start cohort to roughly 180 GitHub requests at the
observed planning average of 30 requests per completed review.
Before its first enqueue, the producer reads the queue-owned contract through
signed `POST /internal/exact-review/admission-capabilities`. Dashboard telemetry cannot
block this capability check. Transport failures retain their HTTP or network
diagnostic; unsupported pacing or replay contracts fail closed. Deploy the
Worker before the updated producer; an older Worker returns HTTP 404.
Scheduled review ingress requires
`scheduled_feed.enqueue_replay: scheduled_disposition_v1` before retrying
transient transport or HTTP 5xx failures with the same signed delivery bytes;
legacy ambiguous receipts fail closed. Publication enqueue remains single-attempt;
batch lifecycle router receipts and terminal dispositions use bounded,
byte-identical retries backed by durable operation identities. Operator
retirement and other callers retain their single-attempt default.
Legacy lifecycle payloads without replay identities remain single-attempt as well.

Normal fanout ordinarily divides one live queue-advertised candidate-capacity
budget across the selected repositories; it does not grant 50 candidates to
each target. If that capacity probe is unavailable, the bounded fallback for a
hourly cycle is `50 items/target * 12 targets = 600 items/cycle`. Its fallback
therefore offers at most 600 candidates/hour before due filtering, planner
capacity clamping, dedupe, and Worker admission. The direct hourly normal
schedule also uses live advertised capacity; its fallback offers 50 items/hour before
the same bounds. These paths therefore have enough candidates to keep the
shared token bucket fed despite dedupe or uneven fleet distribution. The queue
admits at most 60 scheduled reviews/hour, which needs
about `60 * 4.1 / 60 = 4.1` concurrent review workers at a 4.1-minute mean
service time and budgets roughly 1,800 GitHub requests/hour. The separate
32-slot scheduled cap also bounds old queued work and slower reviews while
organic/manual requests retain admission priority. Rate and burst reduce request
and inference demand; the pending soft limit remains a separate queue
backpressure bound and should change only when queue-memory or latency evidence
requires it, not automatically with the request budget.

On saturated queues, normal planning reads the complete bounded open-item scan
before selecting candidates. For the current largest repository this is about
60 REST pages per hourly normal tick, or roughly 60 installation-token
requests per hour; that bounded cost is necessary for oldest-review fairness.

Optional planning-started and in-progress dashboard publishes in the plan job
are capped at 20 seconds. They are useful telemetry, but they must not delay
candidate selection or the review shard matrix; the publish job writes the final
dashboard state after review artifacts land.

The plan jobs calculate live capacity from the GitHub Actions REST runs list,
normalized to the same fields as `gh run list`. The REST endpoint is used because
`gh run list` can miss active repository-dispatch runs in some local and Actions
contexts, which would make the scheduler undercount active review workers. Every
active status is paginated so fleets above 100 runs remain fully counted.

## Cadence

The planner considers only open issues and PRs that pass `shouldPlanItem`.
Protected labels and other non-reviewable items are skipped before Codex work is
allocated.

Review cadence:

- items with target-side activity since the last real review: hourly
- items created in the last 7 days without new target-side activity: daily
- pull requests outside the hot window: daily
- issues created in the last 30 days: daily
- older inactive issues: weekly
- review policy hash changes: due immediately

The activity check ignores ClawSweeper-owned GitHub mutations that are already
recorded in durable report frontmatter. `review_comment_synced_at` covers public
review comment writes, and `labels_synced_at` covers ClawSweeper label-only
writes such as priority or advisory issue-label syncs. If GitHub `updated_at` is
at or before either marker, the planner does not treat it as fresh reporter or
maintainer activity.

Selection uses weighted buckets so hot issues cannot starve pull requests and
older issue backlog forever. The normal scheduler cycles through:

- hot issues
- hot pull requests
- activity-driven items
- daily pull requests
- recent issues
- weekly older issues

Within each bucket, earlier due times and older reviews win before item number.
The live open-item scan is compared with the canonical record index first.
Items with no canonical record consume capacity before any re-review. Within
that never-reviewed cohort, six-day coverage ordering and the existing weighted
bucket mix still apply. Once first-review candidates are exhausted, tracked
items enter the six-day coverage lane in oldest-`reviewed_at` order across all
buckets before hot-item churn. Normal planning completes its bounded scan before
applying that ordering, so a saturated item-number prefix cannot hide either
untracked items or older review timestamps. The extra day is operational
headroom before the seven-day freshness deadline.

## Planning

The plan step runs:

```bash
pnpm run --silent plan -- \
  --target-repo "$TARGET_REPO" \
  --batch-size "$BATCH_SIZE" \
  --max-pages "$MAX_PAGES" \
  --shard-count 1 \
  --codex-model internal \
  --codex-sandbox danger-full-access \
  --min-active-shards 0 \
  --min-backfill-review-age-minutes "$MIN_BACKFILL_REVIEW_AGE_MINUTES"
```

`pnpm run plan` returns:

- `candidates`: selected open items
- `shards`: planner partitions (hosted queue feeds use one partition)
- `capacity`: `batch_size * clamped_shard_count`
- `dueBacklog`: due candidates found during the complete bounded scan
- `activeCodexTarget`: nonempty shard count
- `oldestUnreviewedAt`: oldest scanned due candidate with no existing review
- `capacityReason`: why the selected count did or did not fill capacity
- `floorBackfill`: selected stale current-review candidates used to fill the
  active floor
- `matrix`: legacy CLI output, unused by hosted queue execution

`pnpm run workflow -- plan-output` maps that JSON to GitHub Actions outputs:

- `planned_count`
- `planned_capacity`
- `planned_item_numbers`
- `planned_shards`
- `active_codex_target`
- `due_backlog`
- `oldest_unreviewed_at`
- `capacity_reason`

Capacity reasons:

- `saturated: due backlog filled planned capacity`
- `under capacity: due backlog below planned capacity`
- `idle: no due candidates found`
- `exact: requested item selection`
- `idle: no requested open items found`

## Status and Dashboard

Planning and publish steps call `pnpm run status`, which writes structured JSON
under `results/sweep-status/<repo-slug>.json` in generated state. Every sweep
workflow status update must pass the active `--target-repo` so a ClawHub,
ClawSweeper, or OpenClaw lane updates only its own dashboard row. The README
dashboard reads that JSON and shows:

- active Codex target
- planned review items
- planned review shards
- planned review capacity
- due backlog scanned
- oldest unreviewed scanned
- capacity reason

Historical matrix summaries retain their original shard fields. Current planner
runs report the queue-admission funnel in their Actions summary. Use live queue
and workflow telemetry for active worker counts; a selected candidate is not an
active review.

Plan jobs hydrate canonical records for selection. Each admitted exact-review
worker and publisher follows the existing immutable queue ownership and
publication paths. Apply and audit retain their own state hydration and
reconciliation.

## Apply

Review is proposal-only. Apply is the only issue/PR scheduler path that mutates
GitHub close state.

Apply wakes every 15 minutes for `openclaw/openclaw` and on offset 15-minute
ticks for ClawHub. It re-fetches live GitHub state, checks labels, author
association, paired issue/PR state, snapshot drift, and repository profile
rules. It closes only unchanged high-confidence proposals and otherwise updates
or syncs the durable ClawSweeper review comment.

Apply reconciles hydrated records before both candidate preselection and
execution. Each pass immediately publishes only the item, closed, plan, and
decision-packet paths for record numbers it changed. This keeps folder moves
and closed-item sidecar cleanup durable even when policy filtering, an empty
comment-sync batch, or an empty close queue makes the rest of the run a no-op.
If another publisher updates the same tuple first, its newer tuple wins and
reconciliation defers that item instead of rebuilding stale report or sidecar
content.

Batch review publishers hydrate only the item tuples present in their artifacts,
publish those records, and synchronize the selected durable review comments in
the same job. Exact issue/PR reviews likewise synchronize their selected comments
before completing. Neither path dispatches a second broad comment scan.

Automatic apply may close up to 40 items per run. Long apply runs commit
checkpoints every 40 fresh closes and dispatch a
continuation with a fresh GitHub App token after any checkpoint that closes at
least one item. A saturated scan that closes nothing stops without chaining so
the same records cannot create an unbounded runner loop.

Only automatic close-mode apply runs may queue missing hot or normal review
backstops, including when no close candidates are available. Targeted apply and
comments-only sync retain their requested scope, including when quota pressure
ends the apply process successfully without publishing a comment.

Untargeted cursor-based close apply starts with a 600-record scan window. If
the previous cursor window was a full close-mode scan, closed nothing, skipped
at least 80% of processed records, and did not hit a live-fetch, runtime-budget,
or missing-cursor failure, the next automatic window expands to inspect more
records, capped at 1800. Each automatic checkpoint may spend up to 20 minutes
in deterministic apply scanning, while the existing 55-minute App-token budget,
70-minute apply step, and six-hour coordinator job ceiling remain unchanged.
This changes only the deterministic scan window:
`apply_limit`, checkpoint size, close gates, live-state checks, and maintainer
policy gates stay unchanged. The workflow logs and sweep status detail include
the selected scan window and reason.

Automatic windows reserve up to two candidates for PR close-coverage proof,
capped by the effective close budget. Confirmed proof-gated close proposals stay
ahead of speculative promotion proofs; spare proof capacity rotates promotions
on the same independent proof cursor. Reserved proofs run before deterministic
closes could exhaust the checkpoint's mutation limit. An executor trace advances
each cursor only through records actually examined, so a partial window preserves
unexamined candidates and each pool resumes from its exact last-examined
position. Coverage proof, live-state refresh, freshness checks, and close gates
remain unchanged. Explicit targeted apply runs keep their requested item set and
ordering policy.

Apply keeps selected report bodies in memory and loads independently reviewed
paired records only when a close guard requests them. Exact-event publication
does not expand its selected set. Broad apply still sorts the complete open
candidate set; it no longer loads a second copy for paired lookups. Finalization
reloads only requested, result, and unfinished/in-flight item records from the
open and closed directories, rather than retaining the archive. This includes
partial failures and runtime-budget yields and does not change cursor ordering,
close eligibility, canonical baselines, or ledger identities. OpenClaw Bay needs
no change: the public status, record, and ledger contracts are unchanged.

Before a close-mode apply run starts, the workflow summarizes the selected close
candidate mix by quality bucket in the status detail. Buckets such as
implemented-on-main, duplicate/superseded, needs PR close proof,
aging/low-signal (including stalled-unproven and abandoned PRs),
policy-sensitive, and retry-after-guard-skip are
operator-facing telemetry only; the bucket classification does not change close
limits, live-state checks, or policy gates. Stalled-unproven and abandoned PR
proposals are eligible for apply selection, where the executor re-checks their
PR-only age, activity, proof, status, and human-engagement gates before closing.

After a default close-mode cursor run for `openclaw/openclaw`, the apply job
requeues up to five exact reviews for records whose close was blocked by
source drift (`skipped_changed_since_review`) or by a stored review without
verified local checkout access. Both blocks have the same cure: a fresh exact
review re-verifies the close proposal at the current snapshot and writes a
close-capable record, so the next apply pass can execute instead of skipping
the same stale records every sweep. The per-run cap bounds review spend, and
the exact-item queue's supersession semantics absorb repeat dispatches.

Apply and comment-sync Actions run titles include the target repository. Before
dispatching a default cursor-based apply continuation, the workflow checks
recent active or queued same-target default cursor runs and treats one of those
runs as the continuation instead of adding another pending run. Custom-input
and explicit-item runs have a different title and cannot suppress the default
cursor lane; their own continuations still dispatch with the exact inputs. The
log identifies the default cursor run that covered the continuation.

## Continuation and Recovery

Broad review runs end after queue admission. Periodic schedules and the
apply-lane review backstop offer later candidates under the same shared limits.
The retired matrix publisher and failed-shard recovery jobs do not dispatch
continuations or replay review work. The planner still offers existing canonical
vision-fit OpenClaw reports (under their separate opt-in) and viable reports for
other eligible targets to the bounded implementation-intake dispatcher. The
dedicated strict-bug backfill and exact-publication hooks remain unchanged.

The existing failed-review retry selector remains bounded by its per-source
attempts and cooldown. Both issues and PRs dispatch automatic exact queue work,
never an explicit manual request, so a scanner hold still blocks them. PR retries
retain their head pin. Issue retries carry their expected source revision through
admission and the existing post-hydration guard; changed source ends the retry
without model work or publication and is left to normal source-event/backfill
intake. Repository dispatch uses the workflow repository's default branch;
non-default `--workflow-ref` requests are rejected rather than silently ignored.
Repair follow-ups also use repository dispatch only. A failed dispatch surfaces
to the existing retry handling; it cannot fall back to a manual workflow and
acquire explicit retry authority.

Historical shard artifacts and ledger events remain readable evidence, but are
not active retry authority. The queue owns current review retries, scanner
holds, publication recovery, and stale-lease handling.

Each item report also records durable review cost proxies in front matter and a
`Review Telemetry` section: prompt characters, static prompt characters, GitHub
context characters, output schema characters, additional prompt characters,
context collection milliseconds, and Codex review milliseconds. These fields are
intended for scheduler and prompt-budget experiments, so later throughput work
can compare time and token proxies without scraping transient workflow logs.

The remaining operational state checkout uses a blobless shallow clone. Git
publication is serialized by the Durable Object state-writer coordinator and
uses one ordinary fetch, commit, and push.

## Audit

Audit is read-only and runs separately from review and apply. It refreshes
`results/audit/<repo-slug>.json` and the README Audit Health table from live
GitHub state. Scheduled audit currently covers:

- `openclaw/openclaw`: `7 */6 * * *`
- `openclaw/clawhub`: `12 */6 * * *`
- `openclaw/clawsweeper`: `17 */6 * * *`

The audit lane first tries a ClawSweeper GitHub App read token for the target
repository. If that token is unavailable, it falls back to the workflow token for
public read-only API access so dashboard rows do not remain `unknown` just
because mutating scheduled work is still gated.

Before calculating audit health, audit also runs the folder reconciler against
live open GitHub state. This is target-read-only and mutates only canonical
Worker records: reports for items no longer open move from `items/` to `closed/`,
reopened archived reports move back to `items/`, and duplicate closed copies are
removed. GitHub Actions uses the fast reconciliation mode that does not fetch
each closed item individually for `closed_at`; large cleanup runs therefore avoid
hundreds of per-item GitHub API subprocesses. The local reconciler still fetches
`closed_at` by default for operator runs; pass `--skip-closed-at` for fast
canonical cleanup.

Review publishing applies newly generated artifacts first, then runs the same
fast reconciler once before committing records. It does not run the slower
artifact-apply reconciler and the explicit publish reconciler back to back.

After publishing Git-backed audit results and reconciling canonical records,
audit dispatches the `openclaw/clawsweeper-state` dashboard renderer; that
repository's 15-minute schedule remains the fallback if dispatch is delayed.

## Monitoring

Useful commands:

```bash
gh api 'repos/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs?per_page=100' \
  --jq '.workflow_runs[] | select(.name == "ClawSweeper") | {id,name,display_title,event,status,conclusion,created_at,head_sha,html_url}'

gh run view <run-id> --repo openclaw/clawsweeper --json jobs \
  --jq '[.jobs[] | select(.name == "Review exact event item") | select(.status=="in_progress")] | length'

gh api repos/openclaw/clawsweeper/readme --jq '.content' | base64 --decode
```

Read the remote generated README, not only the local checkout, when checking the
live dashboard. Generated dashboard state is published from GitHub Actions and
can be newer than local files.

## Common Changes

To change review spend, set
`EXACT_REVIEW_TARGET_RATE_PER_HOUR`; the Worker applies the fleet-wide rate
while scheduled planners size their candidate batch to free review capacity.
Target fanout divides that capacity by untracked backlog after reserving its
round-robin fairness slice. To change manual normal Codex sessions, update the
worker limits and workflow defaults together.

To change review cadence, update the cadence constants and the scheduler bucket
logic in `src/clawsweeper.ts`, then update dashboard labels and this document.

To add a new target repository, add a repository profile, wire schedule target
resolution and concurrency target resolution in `.github/workflows/sweep.yml`,
then confirm the generated state paths remain flat under one repo slug.

Hosted owner fallback is limited to `openclaw/*` and `steipete/*`. To schedule
another owner, add explicit repository profiles and include that owner in
`target_inventory.owners`, then wire that owner's inventory token or explicit
public-inventory fallback into the fanout workflow. Configuration alone does
not activate a new owner. Fanout ignores every repository that is not admitted
by the shared configured-profile-or-owner-fallback policy. Keep scheduled
fanout public-only unless the generated records publish to a private state
surface.
