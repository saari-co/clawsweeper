# Operator configuration ownership

- Status: active operator reference
- Owner: ClawSweeper deployment and workflow maintainers
- Source of truth: `dashboard/wrangler.toml` and `.github/workflows/`
- Last verified: `openclaw/clawsweeper@647503ec44b8e777dd172adf974a945367da0d19`
- Update when: an audited name is removed, renamed, or changes responsibility, or a source-verified ownership gap is added to this inventory
- Checked by: `pnpm run check:docs`

This page records names and ownership boundaries only. Never copy secret values
into documentation, issues, logs, or pull requests. The committed Wrangler file
is authoritative for selected deployment values; GitHub repository or
environment settings are authoritative for workflow variables and secrets.

## Dashboard Worker variables

| Name                              | Responsibility                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLAWSWEEPER_REPO`                | Repository used by ClawSweeper-specific projections.                       |
| `PUBLIC_BAY_REPOS`                | Verified-public repositories eligible for minimal Bay/Overview references. |
| `WORKER_DETAIL_RUN_LIMIT`         | Maximum workflow-run detail set fetched for dashboard assembly.            |
| `WORKER_JOB_FETCH_CONCURRENCY`    | Concurrency for workflow-job detail fetching.                              |
| `WORKER_JOB_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`    | Workflow-job cache lifetime.                                               |
| `WORKER_HEALTH_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Workflow-health cache lifetime.                                            |
| `WORKER_HEALTH_FETCH_CONCURRENCY` | Concurrency for workflow-health fetching.                                  |
| `AUTOMERGE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`     | Automerge metrics cache lifetime.                                          |
| `RECENT_CLOSED_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Recently closed item cache lifetime.                                       |
| `INCLUDE_CI_STATUS`               | Enables CI status in dashboard assembly when selected.                     |
| `REVIEW_OBSERVABILITY_REQUIRED`   | Selects whether review observability is required for status assembly.      |
| `REVIEW_RECOVERY_ENABLED`         | Selects review recovery behavior in the deployed Worker.                   |

## Workflow credential names

Provider keys used by the optional OpenClaw runner are `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `KIMI_API_KEY`, and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Maintainer-report
and Cloudflare access workflows reference `CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID`,
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OPENCLAW_CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_API_TOKEN`,
`OPENCLAW_CLOUDFLARE_CONFIG_API_TOKEN`, `OPENCLAW_CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_API_TOKEN`,
`OPENCLAW_REPORTS_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID`, and `OPENCLAW_REPORTS_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`.
Their consuming workflows own whether they are required; no values are recorded
here.

`config/operator-documentation.json` pins this deliberately scoped audited set so
`pnpm run check:docs` fails if a name disappears from its owning source or this
page. It does not require every repository workflow secret or dashboard setting
to be duplicated here. [Automation limits](limits.md) remains canonical for
capacity and timing values.
