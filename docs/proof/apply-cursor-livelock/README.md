# Apply cursor livelock proof

## Claim

The automatic `openclaw/openclaw` apply loop always executes its numeric cursor frontier before
opportunistic urgent repairs, regardless of the order in which `item_numbers` arrives. The loop
chooses the smallest number strictly greater than the active cursor and wraps to the smallest
selected number only when no greater number exists. Per-pass-terminal outcomes can therefore
advance the durable cursor, while a runtime yield on the frontier itself leaves the cursor
unchanged for a truthful retry.

This fixes the livelock observed in production run
https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/31544381133. That run selected 39 urgency-ranked
records before frontier `#105870`, exhausted its 300-second budget at urgent record `#85937`, and
never reached the only record that could advance cursor `#105854`.

## Controlled scenario and fixture

`run-proof.mjs` uses the exact 40-number selection from the production run and a synthetic action
mix matching its terminal classes: durable comment sync, changed-since-review, stale-sync skip,
kept-open, an already-closed canonical record, and a runtime-clipped record.

The selector, apply loop, and cursor-completion helper are exercised four ways:

1. The old urgency-first order examines the terminal urgent prefix but not frontier `#105870`; it
   reports `cursor_count=0` and leaves the cursor at `#105854`.
2. The new batch selector places `#105870` first. After that frontier and the same terminal urgent
   prefix complete, a yield at `#85937` advances the cursor exactly to `#105870`.
3. A yield on the first frontier records no examined item and leaves the cursor at `#105854`.
4. An ascending-sorted request places `#105870` last after four lower urgent records. The apply
   loop nevertheless examines `#105870` first, and completion consumes that trusted execution
   trace to persist `#105870` while every other record remains unexamined.

The proof also runs the repository's focused wrap/cycle tests. The selector reorder remains useful
for non-apply consumers, but the TypeScript apply-loop selection is the load-bearing guarantee.
The implementation does not change `cycle_start_after_number`, `cycle_wrapped`, their reset rules,
or the special automatic-policy branch.

## Run

```bash
docs/proof/apply-cursor-livelock/run-proof.sh
```

The container entrypoint additionally installs jq 1.8.2 only after verifying the
repository-pinned official release digest:

```bash
docs/proof/apply-cursor-livelock/container-proof.sh
```

## Result

`fixture-result.json` is the committed machine-readable fixture result. `behavior-report.json`
records the source-blind behavior validation.

The final committed-head proof ran `2ebe882831f99d9f22dd6f696f48d2a4e80f3195`
inside `node:24-bookworm` through Crabbox `provider=aws`, lease `cbx_a9f86ad7a357`
(`quick-prawn-5920`), run `run_61dcc42eb8d2`. jq 1.8.2 was installed only after its
`jq-linux-amd64` digest matched the repository-pinned value. All five focused fixture/wrap tests
passed, Crabbox exited 0, and the lease stopped automatically. `container-provenance.json` records
the complete receipt and the earlier proof-harness attempts.

## Limits and Bay impact

The fixture reproduces the cursor ownership and runtime-yield boundary without GitHub credentials
or production mutation. It does not reproduce the live API latency or claim that urgent records no
longer require later repair.

OpenClaw Bay is unaffected. This changes only internal apply-lane batch execution order and removes
a redundant pre-lease cleanup attempt; it does not change lifecycle publication or the
observer-only dashboard contract.
