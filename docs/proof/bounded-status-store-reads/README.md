# Bounded StatusStore reads proof

## Claim

The public automerge-metrics and apply-observability responses are unchanged while the dashboard's
`StatusStore` Durable Object no longer reads and reprocesses the full retained event population on
every poll.

Automerge reads use the timestamp embedded in the durable key as the storage range, include a fixed
eight-day pre-window session-context margin, consume the result in storage order, and return only
the completed summary across the Durable Object boundary.
Apply observations are stored in UTC day+repository buckets; reads fetch only overlapping buckets
plus compatible legacy rows and also return only the summary.

## Transition strategy

Apply writes switch directly to day+repository buckets at deploy time. Reads merge those buckets
with the existing per-run legacy keys, deduplicate by repository/run/attempt, and prefer the newest
observation. Legacy rows already have a seven-day TTL, so they disappear without a migration,
backfill, destructive rewrite, or flag day. After that natural drain, only the range's handful of
day buckets are returned from storage.

## Exercised surface

- Real `wrangler dev --local` Worker and SQLite-backed `StatusStore` Durable Object for merge-base
  and candidate.
- Real `/api/events` automerge ingestion and signed `/internal/apply-observability` ingestion.
- Public 6h, 24h, and 7d queries, both unfiltered and repository-filtered; automerge also exercises
  policy filtering.
- Automerge sessions spanning every requested-window boundary, plus a session entirely before the
  6h window, so command-to-merge latency and terminal inclusion match the unbounded implementation.
- A proof-only counting storage adapter around each revision's actual `StatusStore` class. It counts
  rows returned by `list()` and `get()` without changing production code.
- A replayed apply observation exactly at a UTC day boundary.

## Run

From the repository root on Node 24 or newer:

```bash
docs/proof/bounded-status-store-reads/run-proof.sh
```

The harness enables Corepack, installs the locked dependencies, extracts merge-base into a
disposable directory, starts both Wrangler runtimes on loopback, seeds 308 automerge events and 170
apply observations through production routes, and compares 12 normalized responses. Only
request-time-derived fields are normalized: `generated_at`, `range_start`, and automerge bucket
`start`/`end` timestamps.

The eight-day automerge margin is derived from the seven-day active-session reconciliation horizon
in `scripts/dashboard-reconcile-automerge.ts`, plus a 24-hour delayed-delivery cushion. That horizon
also exceeds the 104.84-hour maximum command-to-terminal span observed in the public seven-day
metrics response at `2026-08-11T08:49:10.916Z`. The largest query therefore reads at most 15 days
of the 90-day retained event population.

## Local result

The controlled run completed with all 12 normalized responses byte-identical. Storage-row reads
were:

| Endpoint | Range | Before | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| automerge-metrics | 6h | 6,600 | 690 |
| automerge-metrics | 24h | 6,600 | 744 |
| automerge-metrics | 7d | 6,600 | 1,176 |
| apply-observability | 6h | 169 | 2 |
| apply-observability | 24h | 169 | 4 |
| apply-observability | 7d | 169 | 16 |

See [`artifacts/local-summary.json`](artifacts/local-summary.json),
[`artifacts/row-counts.json`](artifacts/row-counts.json), and the per-query hashes and normalized
payloads in [`artifacts/response-comparison.json`](artifacts/response-comparison.json).

## OpenClaw Bay impact

None. The same observer responses retain the same fields and values; no Bay projection, lifecycle,
control, queue action, or public observer boundary changes.

## Limits

The population is synthetic local data, not production volume or a CPU benchmark. Row counts show
storage records returned to the implementation, not serialized bytes. During transition, live
legacy apply rows are still read and merged until their existing seven-day TTL expires. The proof
performs no production deployment, GitHub write, workflow dispatch, queue mutation, or Bay action.
