# Historical OpenClaw Bay deterministic browser proof

Status: reusable deterministic runner with historical checked-in artifacts.
The recorded artifact source, `0cf6b147fe86f56e4ec8c77352e3d31433e3a1d2`,
is not reachable from current repository history, so the checked-in report and
storyboard must not be treated as current exact-head proof. A new runner receipt
and artifacts must name their exact source SHA.

This proof package exercises the real `/bay` page and its checked-in
artwork in Chromium. Playwright replaces the dashboard's status, history, and
triage reads with fully synthetic, redacted fixtures so stage changes,
telemetry controls, and navigation can be reproduced without live dashboard
data, credentials, or GitHub API traffic.

The post-privacy-boundary throttle chart has a focused runnable entry point:

```bash
bash docs/proof/openclaw-bay/run-throttle-proof.sh
```

It supplies the strict aggregate-only public status shape and verifies the
6-hour, 24-hour, and 7-day throttle fetches, interval summaries, accessible
403/429 series, physical-pool totals, reset-header boundary, and screenshots.

The sequence proves:

- visible partial-telemetry diagnostics;
- public indexability: no robots metadata or `X-Robots-Tag`, while preserving
  `no-store`, CSP, and frame protections;
- the consistent public dashboard header, including a visible Bay link from
  Overview, issue triage, and PR-proof triage;
- the Bay timing badge naming its bounded **review trigger → final review** measurement, completed by the command-status update emitted after the durable review summary;
- a 390px portrait layout that stacks Arriving through Publishing and Applying vertically, keeps the terminal pools at the waterline, and has no horizontal page overflow;
- advancing crustacean-claw and master-sweeper animations;
- a READY flag followed by a physical forward sweep and landing;
- a changed run ID using the retrigger tunnel and resurfacing path;
- GitHub-reference search and focus;
- repository filtering;
- the read-only drawer's safe GitHub item, job, and workflow-run links;
- readable overflow controls that open the known queue sample and explicitly explain when aggregate queue IDs are outside the bounded public projection;
- compact review-admission, result-publication, and State writer charts with labelled y-axes, exact point hover labels, and cached 6-hour, 24-hour, and 7-day range controls;
- closed-bucket GitHub throttle history across those ranges, split by 403/429,
  summarized by physical pool class, and explicit about the 24-hour
  reset-header-detail boundary;
- lightweight hover/focus explanations on the beach lane signs;
- the local-only tide preview advancing through incoming, crest, backwash, and restored states while preserving terminal keys and count;
- the short static reduced-motion tide cue preserving the same preview state;
- completed and failed/cancelled outcomes grouped into their respective terminal pools;
- twenty completed outcomes fitting individually in the expanded terminal pool without a hidden overflow at the standard desktop width, plus a constrained-width layout that keeps twelve labels readable and makes the remaining eight explicit; and
- a generated real tide atomically proving all twenty terminal crustaceans and
  the final completion time are visible before clearing the shared buffer; and
- zero browser-to-GitHub API requests, mutation requests, unexpected console
  errors, or uncaught page errors. The deliberate synthetic health-history
  outage records one expected 503 console error while the resilience state is
  being exercised.

## Artifacts

- The labelled 23-state storyboard and Playwright action, DOM snapshot, and
  network trace were introduced in commit
  `1a5becc69fc1bdbc11e16aa22f5caaa44f05a59d`. They were pruned from the docs
  tree after review and remain available through git history. To inspect the
  historical trace without restoring it to the working tree:

  ```bash
  bay_trace_dir="$(mktemp -d)"
  git show 1a5becc69fc1bdbc11e16aa22f5caaa44f05a59d:docs/proof/openclaw-bay/trace.zip \
    > "$bay_trace_dir/trace.zip"
  npx --yes playwright@1.60.0 show-trace "$bay_trace_dir/trace.zip"
  ```

- [`proof-summary.json`](proof-summary.json) records all 51 passing assertions
  from its accompanying deterministic proof run,
  sanitized request/response metadata, safe drawer links, the unchanged
  terminal keys before and after both preview modes, the proved real-tide
  clear, and the held terminal failure tunnelling to its bounded live retry.
- [`run-proof.mjs`](run-proof.mjs) contains the Playwright assertions and
  artifact renderer. [`run-proof.sh`](run-proof.sh) installs the pinned
  Playwright package in `/tmp`, starts the real local Wrangler Worker, and runs
  that script without changing repository dependencies.
  [`run-throttle-proof.sh`](run-throttle-proof.sh) selects the focused
  aggregate-only throttle proof path.
- [`fixtures/`](fixtures/) contains the exact three checked-in synthetic
  `/api/status` transition responses. The runner derives dense-terminal and
  real-tide responses from the final fixture, provides a synthetic in-memory
  `/api/health-history` response for telemetry, and records the real-tide
  SHA-256 in the summary. It
  fails before launching Chromium if the checked-in sequence drifts.

The historical compact trace omitted Playwright's continuous screenshot film
strip; the storyboard supplied the visual milestones while the trace supplied
the independently inspectable DOM, action, and network record.

From the repository root, reproduce the proof with the known Playwright image:

```bash
BAY_PROOF_SOURCE_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
crabbox run \
  --provider local-container \
  --local-container-image mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.60.0-noble \
  --no-hydrate \
  --allow-env BAY_PROOF_SOURCE_SHA \
  --timing-json \
  --script docs/proof/openclaw-bay/run-proof.sh \
  --require-artifact '.artifacts/openclaw-bay-proof/trace.zip' \
  --artifact-glob '.artifacts/openclaw-bay-proof/**'
```

These hashes are for the canonical LF bytes materialized from the exact Git
tree inside the Linux proof container. A Windows checkout may display a
different working-tree hash when Git applies CRLF conversion.

The browser allowed only `bay-proof.test:8787`, mapped to the local Wrangler
Worker. The trace contains no cookies or authorization headers. A binary text
scan also found no GitHub tokens, local Windows user paths, usernames, or live
private payloads.

This is deterministic interaction proof, not a claim that synthetic state is
live operational evidence. The separate deployment smoke covers the canonical
`/bay` route, the query-stripping legacy redirect, response headers, shared
schema, and static assets.
