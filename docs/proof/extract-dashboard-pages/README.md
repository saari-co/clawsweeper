# Dashboard page renderer extraction proof

## Claim

Extracting the server-side dashboard page renderers from `dashboard/worker.ts` into
`dashboard/dashboard-pages.ts` does not change the rendered bytes for `/`, `/triage`, or
`/pr-proof-triage`.

## Exercised surface

[`run-proof.sh`](run-proof.sh) starts the real local Wrangler Worker twice: once from the exact
`origin/main` merge base in a detached temporary worktree and once from the current committed head.
It fetches all three moved page surfaces, normalizes ISO timestamps and generated 40-character
hexadecimal SHAs, and requires the normalized diff to be empty. The source-blind validator executes
the separate [`behavior contract`](behavior-contract.md) through HTTP only.

## Artifacts

- `artifacts/page-comparison.json`: base/head byte counts, raw hashes, normalized hashes, and equality
- `artifacts/normalized.diff`: the normalized page diff; this file is empty on success
- `artifacts/behavior-validation.json`: source-blind HTTP behavior report
- `artifacts/provenance.json`: local runtime and exact base/head commits
- `artifacts/base-worker.log` and `artifacts/head-worker.log`: real Wrangler startup/request traces

## Run

From the repository root on Node 24 or newer:

```bash
docs/proof/extract-dashboard-pages/run-proof.sh
```

The script prints `PROOF_RC=0` on success.

## Local observation

The committed local run compared merge base `5a964dadc8131e6e6dc33e9be3536b8141d1d107` with head
`22d7808c136a10503fc9929fd9ba5904e005542f` on macOS arm64, Node 24.19.0, pnpm 11.10.0,
and Wrangler 4.107.0. All three raw response hashes and byte counts matched before normalization;
the normalized diff was empty, the source-blind behavior contract passed, and the harness completed
with `PROOF_RC=0`.

## Crabbox container observation

The same proof passed from a clean `--fresh-pr openclaw/clawsweeper#1116 --no-hydrate`
checkout at pushed head `a00e31c5ae40e33ab8718facac74d39d198dd994` inside Docker-backed Crabbox
`provider=local-container`, image `node:24-bookworm`, lease `cbx_36172f52e311`
(`golden-crayfish-3c9c`). Corepack supplied pnpm 11.10.0, and the upstream jq 1.8.1 checksum
manifest verified `jq-linux-amd64: OK` before execution. The real Worker comparison completed with
`PROOF_RC=0` and `CONTAINER_PROOF_RC=0`; the normalized diff was empty, and Crabbox stopped the
lease automatically. The container run exercised the exact proof rather than the full suite, so the
known three-failure blob-hydration baseline was not applicable.

See the [machine-readable Crabbox provenance](artifacts/crabbox-local-container-provenance.json).

## Limits

This proves page-shell rendering and route-level HTTP behavior. It does not exercise JSON API data,
browser interaction, GitHub writes, queue or state mutation, production deployment, or `/bay-demo`.
The `/bay-demo` renderer already lives in `dashboard/bay-page.ts` and is not part of the moved
surface.

## OpenClaw Bay impact

None. The rendered output is byte-identical, and this ownership-only move changes no Bay data
contract, lifecycle projection, observer-only boundary, or controls.
