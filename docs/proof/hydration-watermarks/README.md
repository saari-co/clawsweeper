# Per-PR hydration watermark proof

The signed Crabbox receipt proves the review-side hydration snapshot and activity-revision validation
at the implementation head recorded in its command, using Docker-backed Crabbox `local-container`.

The deterministic counting fixture models three unchanged and two changed PRs. Legacy hydration is
`2 * P = 10` commit/review-comment list reads. The candidate makes four GraphQL requests total: one
batched planning request for the five PRs plus one hydration-time revision check for each of the three
cache-hit candidates. Those unchanged PRs make zero list reads; an edited-comment PR makes one
`since` review-comment read and a changed-head PR makes two full reads: 7 total requests. Changed
hydration windows and complete inputs compare byte-for-byte with fresh full hydration. A
delete-plus-add fixture proves an invisible deletion causes merged ID cardinality to exceed the live
count and falls back to a full read.

The planner validation, hydration-time revalidation, and same coordinator passed through the real GitHub CLI transport against public
`openclaw/clawsweeper` PR #97. The endpoint returned its known edited review comment from a historical
`since` query. The planner made one GraphQL request; three snapshot reuses each made one just-in-time
GraphQL revision check and no list call; a
synthetic activity-revision change with unchanged parent metadata made one live
`since` request; a synthetic changed head made one live commit-list and one live review-comment-list
request. The proof is read-only.

Before implementation, a controlled probe on PR #1153 established the field contract: ADD introduced
a review, thread, comment ID, and comment timestamp; EDIT advanced the comment timestamp without
moving the parent PR timestamp; DELETE removed the review/thread/comment tuple while the parent PR
timestamp remained unchanged. The probe comment was deleted and its endpoint returned 404. The
revision therefore hashes all bounded thread/comment IDs and comment timestamps plus thread, comment,
and review counts. The hydration coordinator rechecks that same revision immediately before consuming
a candidate snapshot. A mismatch or any check error fails closed to normal hydration, so an edit in
the planning-to-hydration window cannot serve stale input.

ClawSweeper's first review identified that the initial snapshot retained whole REST objects. The
repaired snapshot now accepts only an exact minimized schema: commit SHA/login/message/author name
and the review-comment fields consumed by filtering, prompt compaction, related-link discovery,
content revision, and the activity cursor. A regression injects unrelated API metadata and proves it
never appears in serialized canonical state. Full comment bodies remain because they are required to
reconstruct byte-identical public review inputs.

The second review found that the persistence-only snapshot was attached to `ItemContext` and would
therefore enter Codex prompt JSON and media URL discovery. The repaired serializers explicitly omit
the snapshot while retaining the compact commit/review-comment windows. Focused sentinels prove a
compact review comment remains visible and the full cached comment is absent from both boundaries.

The final review found that the independent 1 MiB snapshot cap could still push a valid review over
the canonical publication boundary. The repaired report renderer now measures the complete serialized
UTF-8 record against the publication owner's shared 2 MiB constant. If the record is too large, it
replaces only the snapshot front-matter value with `unknown`; the review body remains byte-identical
and the next cycle rehydrates from GitHub. The boundary regression covers both this oversized fallback
and normal-size snapshot retention.

The full `pnpm run check` gate passed 3,419 tests: 3,411 passed, 8 skipped, and 0 failed. The focused
planner/coordinator/context/workflow proof passed 156 of 156 tests. The normalized transcript and stderr were
scanned with TruffleHog 3.96.0: 0 verified and 0 unknown secrets.

The canonical Worker report owns the cache metadata; the Git `clawsweeper-state` branch receives no
new file. OpenClaw Bay is unaffected because the publication limit and observer-facing record schema
are unchanged. The final container proof is read-only; the earlier field-choice experiment's temporary
GitHub comment was deleted. No Worker, lifecycle, or dashboard state was mutated.
