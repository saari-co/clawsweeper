# CSW-127 Phase 0.6 real behavior proof contract

## Scope and authority

- Base: `openclaw/clawsweeper` `main` at `6494ab5eb285cc2993d4679d6723e4b2486de99c`.
- Branch: `codex/csw-127-phase0-6`.
- Effective runtime: `danger-full-access`, approval `never`, network enabled.
- Authorized proof scope: reconcile and prove the exact PR head and prepare the final merge
  preflight. Any merge still requires separate explicit approval under repository policy.
  After an approved merge, only automatically triggered deployment and read-only post-deploy
  monitoring are in scope. No manual workflow dispatch, queue/DLQ mutation,
  capacity/schedule/admission change, gate change, or Phase 1 activation.
- PR #1145 remains independent and untouched; Phase 1 stays default-disabled.

## Evidence-driven claims

1. A row-cap eviction records the greatest timestamp actually evicted, not the time at which
   eviction ran. A 15-minute or one-hour query is complete when every evicted rollup/rate-limit
   row is older than that query window, even if an old-row cap eviction happened recently.
2. Legacy diagnostics that cannot prove which timestamps were evicted fail closed. Missing,
   late, truncated, or genuinely evicted in-window evidence must never be represented as
   complete, and observed conservation totals must never be fabricated.
3. Publication retry, backoff, supersession, refresh, and retry-exhausted/DLQ transitions are
   durably reconciled in bounded five-minute cause buckets. Public rows use only closed,
   privacy-safe dimensions: transition, completion stage/kind/reason, revision relation,
   credential pool, recovery cause, backoff class, and attempt bucket. They expose no target,
   item, credential, run, artifact, lease, or error fingerprint.
4. A replayed completion cannot double-count transition telemetry. Restart, deduplication,
   retention, and cardinality caps preserve the same queue transition and public summary.
5. Existing reset-plus-jitter admission behavior, command resumption, typed exits, pool owner
   isolation, v1/v2 compatibility, Bay/status semantics, and rollback behavior are unchanged.
   PR #1169's bounded webhook run confirmation, exact rechecks, unknown-health handling, and
   phantom queued-run eviction remain intact and independent of publication telemetry.
6. The Phase 0.5 sixth-recovery signal supports diagnostic attribution only. Retry limits,
   backoff delays, capacity, and scheduling remain unchanged unless deterministic proof finds a
   separate product defect.
7. The target-App closure-proof 403 path remains owner-scoped and separate from the shared
   repository-Actions circuit. It is documented as a separate follow-up unless proof shows a
   tightly coupled correctness defect.

## Deterministic proof matrix

- Reproduce the false-incomplete bug by evicting only out-of-window rollups at the row cap, then
  prove 15-minute and one-hour queries complete while an overlapping eviction remains incomplete.
- Cover old-schema restart, deduplicated receipt replay, retention boundaries, missing/late
  buckets, row truncation, rate-limit truncation, and conservation without synthesized rows.
- Drive same-revision retry/backoff, newer-revision supersession, repository-Actions throttle
  deferral, unknown-failure exhaustion into DLQ, and post-restart public cause reconciliation.
- Prove that a terminal batch outcome after a prior same-revision failure preserves the existing
  failure depth instead of charging another attempt to the terminal transition.
- Assert all public cause dimensions are closed and bounded and sentinel repository/item/token/
  lease/artifact/error values never appear.
- Run focused telemetry/queue/workflow tests, broad Linux gates, `git diff --check`, and
  `actionlint` if workflow YAML changes.

## Production-shaped boundary proof

Run a real Worker plus SQLite Durable Object boundary in Docker-backed Crabbox local-container.
The proof must ingest signed telemetry through the Worker route, cross a Durable Object restart,
exercise old-row and overlapping cap eviction, complete publication transitions through the
queue route, and read the public observer/status surfaces. Record exact head, provider, image,
lease/run ID, commands, redacted transcript, observed result, and limits.

## Review and delivery gates

- Dirty-patch Codex review, accepted-finding fixes, focused proof rerun, then committed-range
  Codex review against the actual base.
- Local ClawSweeper `--local-range` review from a clean committed branch.
- Put the refreshed Real Behavior Proof package in the main PR body, request one normal
  `@clawsweeper re-review`, and monitor CI/CodeQL without manual reruns.
- When separately and explicitly approved, merge only through an ordinary expected-head squash
  after the exact current head/body is clean, all required checks and reviews pass, and no
  unresolved or requested-change threads remain.
- Start the separately authorized baseline-plus-24 stable-cohort monitor only after automatic
  deployment and live smoke prove the squash SHA.
