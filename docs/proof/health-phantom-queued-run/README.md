# Phantom queued-run health proof

Production `/api/status` probes on 2026-08-14 reported one queued run aging
monotonically from 54 to 61 minutes even though live Actions inventories across
the nine involved repositories contained no queued, waiting, or pending run
older than 30 minutes. The symptom began after
[openclaw/clawsweeper#1167](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/pull/1167)
moved dashboard workflow health onto the webhook read model.

The complete-census gate itself was present: a workflow snapshot is usable only
after a successful run census and an observed `workflow_run` delivery. The gap
was below that repository-wide envelope. A queued row preserved because it
arrived after a census began had no per-row confirmation age in the consumer
response. A later fresh census timestamp therefore made the whole snapshot
usable while `statusSnapshot()` counted that unconfirmed queued row directly.
Repair upserts also ignored an equal `updated_at`, so a live poll that confirmed
an unchanged genuinely queued run could not refresh its row age.

Workflow reads now expose each run's last delivery-or-poll confirmation. Before
an expired row can contribute to `queued_over_threshold`, the Worker rechecks
at most the ten oldest stale rows per refresh. Ten is two waves at the existing
five-way concurrency, bounded below the 20-second refresh cadence even when
each exact request reaches its 4.5-second timeout. Omitted unconfirmed rows are
excluded from queue pressure and make health `unknown`; successive refreshes
continue through the backlog. Structured batch telemetry records the selected
and omitted counts. Live active state refreshes the row. Completed or missing
state removes the run and its dependent job snapshot behind a
verification-start boundary, then emits
`github_read_model_workflow_run_evicted`. A failed exact read removes the
unconfirmed row from the calculation and makes telemetry `unknown`. Repair-only
snapshots without observed subscription coverage still use the pre-#1167 live
status polls. Rows older than the existing 24-hour zombie boundary stay in the
separate zombie metrics and do not spend exact verification requests.

The executable contract is in [behavior-contract.md](behavior-contract.md), the
captured RED/GREEN result is in [red-green.md](red-green.md), and
[run-proof.sh](run-proof.sh) runs the focused loopback fixture, dashboard-strict,
the complete repository gate, static JSON validation, and committed-object
cross-checks in Docker-backed Crabbox. [behavior-report.json](behavior-report.json)
records the source-blind result. The final container receipt and compact
transcripts are recorded beside these files after the isolated run.

[worker-loopback-report.json](worker-loopback-report.json) is the real-boundary
trace requested in the first ClawSweeper review. It starts `wrangler dev
--local`, uses the real SQLite Durable Object plus signed webhook/repair HTTP
routes, waits through the five-minute production TTL, and serves exact completed
and 404 responses from a separate loopback GitHub HTTP server. Its round-3
scenario seeds 205 additional stale rows, proves a maximum of ten exact reads
per refresh with oldest-first selection and unknown health for omissions, then
drains the backlog across successive refreshes. The resulting
`/api/status` response was healthy, all 207 non-zombie candidates were absent
afterward, and the Worker emitted both original eviction telemetry verdicts.
The trace also seeds a 25-hour zombie, proves that no exact request is spent on
it, and leaves only that separately observable zombie row in the read model.

OpenClaw Bay is unaffected. The change repairs the dashboard's internal
observer read path and adds no public field or queue, workflow, GitHub, DLQ,
recovery, deploy, or rollback action.
