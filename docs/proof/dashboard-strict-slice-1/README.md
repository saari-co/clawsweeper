# Dashboard strict slice 1 proof

## Claim

Enabling strict TypeScript checks for the allowlisted small dashboard modules
does not change the dashboard Worker's queue or status responses.

## Exercised surface

`run-proof.mjs` reuses the established real-Worker comparison in
`docs/proof/queue-policy-readmodel-extraction/run-proof.mjs`. It archives the
merge-base, starts merge-base and candidate Workers through local Wrangler,
seeds each independent SQLite-backed `ExactReviewQueue` through the signed
enqueue route, and compares normalized `/api/exact-review-queue` and
`/api/status` JSON bytes.

The wrapper requires a clean committed checkout and writes a slice-specific
summary under ignored `.artifacts/dashboard-strict-slice-1/`. Its receipt is
`COMMITTED` only when `HEAD` is a commit and tracked files are clean.

## Run

From the repository root on Node 24 or newer:

```bash
docs/proof/dashboard-strict-slice-1/run-proof.sh
```

## Expected observation

- the seeded merge-base and candidate queues both accept six items;
- normalized queue and status responses are byte-identical;
- the proof summary records the merge-base, candidate head, response hashes,
  and `COMMITTED` receipt;
- no production system is contacted or mutated.

## OpenClaw Bay and limits

OpenClaw Bay is unaffected. Its public projection is included in the normalized
status response and remains byte-identical and observer-only; this slice adds
no queue, workflow, GitHub, recovery, deploy, or rollback action.

The scenario uses synthetic pending reviews and a deterministic loopback
GitHub error stub. It does not contact GitHub, acquire review leases, publish
records, deploy a Worker, or mutate production.
