# Fixed-SHA issue enrichment behavior contract

## Claim

Repeated high-confidence issue decisions with the same `fixed_sha` reuse the fixing pull-request
association already present in the hydrated canonical report without making a GitHub request. Cold
resolutions share one recent-pulls list per repository process, resolve authoritative merge-SHA
associations from that list, and use `GET /commits/:sha/pulls` for head-only or absent associations.

## Exercised surface

- The production `createStatusContext` resolver used by the review command after Codex returns a
  decision and before the report is rendered.
- The production review workflow handoff of the prior canonical report to that resolver.
- The existing `fixed_sha` and high-confidence `fixed_pr_*` report fields; no new state schema or
  state write is introduced.
- A counting fixture with four repeat resolutions and three cold resolutions: one merge-SHA list
  match, one shared-head-SHA exact lookup, and one absent-SHA exact lookup.
- A public live-transport fixture using `openclaw/clawsweeper` PR #1138 / issue #1135 through the
  real `gh api` client, with resolver routes recorded after setup discovery.

## Expected observable behavior

- Repeat decisions return the byte-equivalent persisted `FixedPullRequest` tuple and make zero
  GitHub calls.
- A recent `merge_commit_sha` match is authoritative and makes no per-SHA pull request, even when a
  different pull shares that SHA as its head.
- Cold merge matches retain the existing merged/default-branch/explicit-closing-reference guards and
  the existing `GitHub commit PR lookup` source.
- A fixed SHA represented only as a PR head uses the exact per-SHA association set, preserving the
  legacy newest-merged selection when multiple PRs share that head.
- A fixed SHA absent from the recent list uses the existing per-SHA commit-pulls lookup and
  commit-message fallback.
- The counting fixture changes from 7 `commit_pulls` requests to 1 pulls-list request plus 2
  `commit_pulls` fallbacks. In general, before is `R + C`; after is `1 + (C - C_merge)`, where
  `C_merge` is the number of authoritative merge-SHA matches and repeats contribute zero.
- A changed `fixed_sha` never reuses the prior association.

## State and architecture boundary

The plan job hydrates canonical `records/<repo-slug>/items/<number>.md` records from the Cloudflare
Worker, and `prepare-review-runtime.mjs` copies the selected prior records into each review runtime.
The review report already persists the association as `fixed_pr_*`, so reuse belongs at the review
resolver boundary. The `clawsweeper-state` Git branch no longer owns records and receives no new
cache file; its remaining `jobs/**`, `results/**`, and notification state are untouched.

OpenClaw Bay is unaffected. This changes neither lifecycle publication nor any status, telemetry, or
dashboard data contract.

## Limits

The recent-pulls optimization intentionally inspects the newest 100 pull requests. Merge-commit
matches in that window are authoritative; head-only or otherwise unmatched associations retain the
exact per-SHA fallback, which preserves the complete newest-merged legacy choice even when candidates
fall outside the window. The proof uses deterministic
GitHub API fixtures plus a read-only public GitHub transport in a Docker-backed Crabbox container. It
does not mutate GitHub, publish Worker state, deploy, or measure production latency. The live fixture
depends on public PR #1138 remaining inside the newest 100 pull requests while the receipt is made.
