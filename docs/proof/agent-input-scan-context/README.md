# Exact fixture admission in committed patches

The scanner admits reviewed synthetic URIs in context, added, and removed patch
lines while continuing to scan the complete patch. Context binds both committed
regular-file blobs; added and removed lines bind the head and base respectively.
Changed lines require exact ordered full-line attribution policy. Legacy rows
remain context-only. Every literal occurrence and every retained source reference
must qualify through canonical paths, full object IDs, and hunk coordinates.

New and deleted files also require an unambiguous host-captured raw Git A/D
record proving the absent endpoint. The full present-file hunk and rehashed blob
must agree. Missing blobs and textual `/dev/null` headers alone cannot qualify.

The regression suite uses the public classifier and real Git-generated patches
for additions, removals, new files, and deletions. It rejects missing, conflicting,
and malformed raw endpoint evidence; incomplete hunks; wrong newline markers;
unapproved full lines, aliases, modes, roles, and revisions; encoded-only content;
verified or mixed findings; and duplicate exact-attribution records. It preserves
legacy changed-line refusal, separate decoder/line attribution, and legacy
duplicate counts. CRLF bytes and files without a final newline are covered.

```bash
pnpm build:node
node --test test/agent-input-scan.test.ts test/agent-input-scan-fixtures.test.ts
node docs/proof/agent-input-scan-context/run-proof.mjs \
  /path/to/trusted/openclaw \

  b8382f64ea7db05db1b0a6ac3c7ae80b68025fc3 \
  /path/to/admission-proof.json
```

The proof uses `scanAgentInput`, its pinned native scanner, isolated environment,
canonical verification, complete committed source range, and a controlled prompt.
Only safe classifier notices and a bounded result are retained. It does not run
a model or replace the hosted review's own prompt/schema/source admission.

The separate [Autoreview BASE64 qualification](autoreview-base64.md) records
the bounded blob-only policy, its historical native refusal, and the executed
candidate qualification with its distinct baseline observation.

## Model-egress fixtures

OpenClaw [PR 156207](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/156207) adds two
mock loopback proxy credentials and an endpoint-rejection URI. The input scan in
[run 35822733897](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/35822733897)
refused these unqualified fixtures before model execution. The host policy binds
each native Raw/RawV2 digest, complete source-line digest, original test path,
regular-file mode, and observed `PLAIN` or `HTML` decoder. No target ignore rule,
fixture-name pattern, scanner-verification change, or production credential is involved.

The controlled proof uses the complete committed source range that failed:

```bash
node docs/proof/agent-input-scan-context/run-proof.mjs \
  /path/to/disposable/openclaw-at-pr-head \
  8868f7ed8c1e340c5eb70d796b58955d042638d4 \
  15c14e982fd7640a77b0c2b9bab6e5b4b168f705 \
  /path/to/model-egress-admission-proof.json
```

Native macOS arm64, Node 26.8.2, and pinned TruffleHog 3.97.4 reproduced six
unverified URI findings across source blobs and the generated patch before
qualification. The same range admits after qualification with verification
enabled. The existing exact-attribution regression harness now covers all three
identities in additions, removals, and unchanged context; changed values, lines,
paths, modes, roles, verification status, unsupported decoders, and additional
literal occurrences remain refused.

OpenClaw Bay is unaffected: the change only qualifies host-side scanner input;
it changes no dashboard API, queue lifecycle, or public action surface.

OpenClaw PR [149354](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/149354) supplies the
real regression source. Hosted runs
[35012046356](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/35012046356)
and [35014912047](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/35014912047)
independently refused the unchanged create-profile fixture and unchanged patch
context respectively. The original source-row fixture dates to
[103139](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/103139); its complete line did
not change in this browser repair.

OpenClaw Bay is unaffected: this changes scanner admission and host-side proof
notices, not the dashboard API or public action surfaces.

The plugin settings stack adds a committed-range case with both a new test file
and added fixture lines in an existing test file:

```bash
node docs/proof/agent-input-scan-context/run-proof.mjs \
  /path/to/trusted/openclaw \
  3a4f9db62ee46701c3e7c494d981b07c74170c8f \
  598dc5aebd5aee9488f39898b2d6041f3993cc46 \
  /path/to/plugin-fixture-admission-proof.json
```

This is the complete source range for OpenClaw PR
[149330](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/149330) at that head. It exercises
both exact source-blob attribution and added-line attribution, including the
new file's captured absence evidence. Native verification and completion checks
remain unchanged.

## Autoreview hardening fixtures

Claim: the maintainer-reviewed synthetic URI fixtures in the canonical autoreview
hardening test and its OpenClaw mirror admit through exact source attribution,
including Git-generated changed lines; a one-byte literal change still refuses.
This qualifies six identities at both exact paths without changing scanner,
verification, completion, source, mode, or patch-provenance gates.

The canonical file at agent-skills
`a7e91e188fa0c3d692ac69b3137f24c6c3a2d2c9` and the mirror in OpenClaw PR
[152039](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/152039) at
`b2d3d0f86be704f80a04c11110aa1a7082a961a6` are byte-identical: 325358 bytes,
SHA-256 `87f42dcab4063224e75202ea0b47520c56ed7e283772a63572b332a1394893d8`.
[The identity evidence](autoreview-hardening/identities.json) records full
Raw/RawV2 and complete source-line digests, source paths, modes, and decoders.
Every identity occurs once in that file. The encoded-newline and encoded-NUL
identities share one complete source line.

Native scans emitted different finding subsets for identical bytes. In addition
to the four originally reported identities, they observed the empty-username
proxy fixture on head line 6596 and the encoded-NUL rejection fixture on line 6609. Both are in `AuthenticatedProxyTests`; neither comes from material outside
the reviewed autoreview test. These additional rows permit only observed PLAIN
decoding. Native evidence retained here is PLAIN; HTML coverage for the original
four identities uses constructed classifier records, not recovered native evidence.

The controlled runtime proof uses the complete committed range, the canonical
pinned TruffleHog 3.97.4 scanner, and enabled verification. It ran on September 18,
2026 using native macOS arm64, Node 26.8.2, and pnpm 12.4.1 (provider: local host;
no container image or lease). The trusted OpenClaw checkout stayed unchanged;
a disposable shared-object checkout was pinned to the PR head because committed
admission requires the checkout HEAD to match. The base is the merge base obtained
from the trusted checkout's origin/main.

```bash
pnpm build:node
node docs/proof/agent-input-scan-context/run-proof.mjs \
  /path/to/disposable/openclaw-at-pr-head \
  a9fea70fcba242ff715cf248291c19c2e469de4c \
  b2d3d0f86be704f80a04c11110aa1a7082a961a6 \
  /path/to/admission-proof.json
```

[Before qualification](autoreview-hardening/before.json), the proof refused with
`findings / literal_not_reviewed` and no success notices. After qualification,
three consecutive runs of the same range admitted with zero refusals:
[run 1](autoreview-hardening/after-1.json),
[run 2](autoreview-hardening/after-2.json), and
[run 3](autoreview-hardening/after-3.json). They retained four, three, and three
bounded success notices respectively. An external observation hook recorded only
native finding hashes and line witnesses; it left scanner arguments, output,
exit status, and classification unchanged.

The regression suite separately exercises additions and removals using real Git
patches at both paths, all qualified decoder variants, every one-byte literal
mutation, and changed source lines for the existing legacy value. Retaining the
legacy row for review-context omission does not restore value-only changed-line
admission.

Limits: this proof runs no model and does not replace admission of the hosted
review's own prompt, schema, and source inputs. Three successful repetitions
establish the requested bounded repeatability evidence, not a guarantee about
every future scanner finding. OpenClaw Bay is unaffected: only host-side fixture
attribution changes; there is no dashboard API, telemetry, or public-action change.

### Malformed proxy prefix qualification

Historical qualification, September 24, 2026: agent-skills
[PR 274](https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills/pull/274) at
`3cea808464166fa205092958b1da075334396bff` retained an unchanged synthetic
malformed-proxy rejection fixture. It predates that PR, introduced by
`567e63060e03503e965e91f0af06c5633be1221f`. The test supplies a reserved invalid
host through a mocked environment and expects rejection before engine startup.

The original hosted scan in
[run 35954755271](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/35954755271)
reported 11 findings and retained metadata identifying head blob
`076472cab0910a2fc56620e82e76260269b01ad6`, line 4661, as an unqualified PLAIN URI.
Its raw identities and original prompt were not retained. An unchanged-policy
full-input reproduction observed nine findings and reproduced that exact source
coordinate. Eight findings matched existing policy; the ninth was the malformed
port's native prefix. The reproduced nine records do not recover the original 11.

The native Raw and RawV2 digest is
`7b8ee01b06a7e5b375164f2c45249bb258c75726a60b27e20a0ba6e42d5d0b27`.
That prefix also occurs in the existing valid-proxy fixture. Both occurrences
therefore require the exact ordered full-line digests
`1a0920c31a227ead081fd2e6582572dfee060995e266a5520f66021acaa918c9` and
`c445f98d7d20b87bca6fead0e081385981add30abd58123db8d8d71c799d14a9`.
The two host-policy rows bind only the canonical test path and its OpenClaw
mirror, regular-file mode, URI detector, and observed PLAIN decoding. HTML,
changed suffixes outside the native match, missing or reordered witnesses,
extra occurrences, and other unqualified findings remain refused.

Qualification leaves the source fixtures, legacy omission policy, classifier,
scanner arguments, enabled verification, and non-retryable refusal unchanged.
The controlled native proof uses the complete committed range, the current
public PR metadata and discussion through `serializeReviewContext`, the host
review template, and the actual decision schema. It runs no model and cannot
replace the hosted review's own admission of its exact prompt and source.
OpenClaw Bay is unaffected; no queue, API, or public action surface changes.

Native macOS arm64 proof used Node 26.7.0 and pinned TruffleHog 3.97.4. The
canonical before/after runs had identical prompt, schema, all 14 staged input
hashes, scanner binary, and arguments. The first admitted run omitted the new
identity; one bounded follow-up admitted seven findings including that identity
at both base and head. OpenClaw's byte-identical, then-unpublished mirror candidate
`56f6f6a7210e77188c14b2e43d74388d54dd9b57`, against base
`4f6eb26b1beda60044ee9b94cd352f37c63718e9`, admitted nine findings across 22 staged
inputs, including the qualified prefix at both endpoints. The classifier's
success notices confirmed the exact canonical and mirror source paths.

## Question URL rejection fixture

Maintainer-approved qualification: admit only the existing
synthetic userinfo-rejection fixture in `ui/src/app/question-prompt.test.ts`.
The fixture was introduced by OpenClaw commit
`a37eb17fdfd688e0ed7e7be31950381cf15fb9bd` and is unchanged at line 220 in both
endpoints of [PR 152096](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/152096).
[Identity evidence](question-prompt/identities.json) records both full blob IDs,
the regular-file mode, complete source-line digest, and native match digests.

Native TruffleHog 3.97.4 reports the same fixture through PLAIN or HTML decoding.
Its Raw value omits the path and RawV2 stops before the hyphen in `/sign-in`.
Both proposed attribution tuples therefore bind the complete original source
line as well as the native Raw/RawV2 pair, detector 17, exact path, and mode
`100644`. No value-only fixture row, scanner option, verification check, source
binding, or patch-attribution rule changes.

The controlled native proof ran on macOS arm64 with Node 24.21.0 and pnpm 12.4.1,
using a disposable OpenClaw worktree pinned to the requested head. It exercises
the complete PR source range with verification enabled:

```bash
pnpm build:node
node docs/proof/agent-input-scan-context/run-proof.mjs \
  /path/to/disposable/openclaw-at-pr-head \
  24caac494ee4858989e58300925c5775a4dd45b2 \
  1db1bd5c9289f5c348e2c06ce0253aa9f5533584 \
  /path/to/question-fixture-proof.json
```

[Before qualification](question-prompt/before.json), the native proof refuses
with `literal_not_reviewed`, matching the hosted review diagnostic. The same
range admits in three consecutive runs:
[run 1](question-prompt/after-1.json), [run 2](question-prompt/after-2.json), and
[run 3](question-prompt/after-3.json). Adjacent `.native.json` observations retain
only finding hashes, coordinates, and bounded native metadata; the observation
hook does not alter scanner arguments, results, exit status, or classification.

The focused regression exercises real Git-generated added, removed, and context
lines for both decoders. It also refuses a one-byte literal change, changed full
source line, different path, executable mode, verified finding, and unqualified
decoder. Existing scanner tests retain all other admission guards.

Limits: no model runs, no hosted review is bypassed, and no runtime policy is
published by this proof. Hosted review must scan its own complete inputs after
an approved rollout. OpenClaw Bay is unaffected; only host-side fixture
qualification changes, with no dashboard API or action surface change.

## GitHub unsafe-check-link fixture

Maintainer-approved qualification for the single synthetic userinfo-rejection
fixture in `extensions/github/src/detail-checks.test.ts`, introduced by
[OpenClaw PR 153274](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/153274). The test
asserts that unsafe check-run and commit-status URLs are omitted. Its reserved
example hostname and synthetic userinfo are test data, not live credentials.

[Identity evidence](pr153274/identities.json) binds the complete source line,
regular-file mode, source blob, native Raw/RawV2 hashes, and captured Git A record
for this new file. The qualification adds only the observed URI detector's PLAIN
and HTML variants at that exact source path. It does not add a value-only row or
a directory-wide exemption.

The controlled proof ran on Linux x64 with Node 26.8.2, pnpm 12.4.1, and the
canonical pinned TruffleHog 3.97.4 scanner, with verification enabled. A disposable
shared-object checkout was pinned to the real PR head; the canonical source
checkout was not changed. From a built ClawSweeper checkout:

```bash
pnpm run build:node
node docs/proof/agent-input-scan-context/run-proof.mjs \
  /path/to/disposable/openclaw-at-pr-head \
  6f3aa8d6bc409bd4502902382c0055ed489ace38 \
  4df6f54115cde20d9225f791805a82b4bfcf3898 \
  /path/to/fixture-admission-proof.json
```

[Before qualification](pr153274/before.json), the full committed range refused
with `findings / material_not_reviewed`. Native observations retained only
finding hashes and coordinates; scanner arguments, output, status, and
classification were unchanged. All observed findings had the same Raw/RawV2
identity. HTML decoding can report patch line 511 while the literal is on line
512; the existing owner resolves that literal to committed source line 388.
The qualification binds the actual complete source line, never the neighboring
line or the scanner coordinate alone.

The same range admitted in three consecutive runs:
[run 1](pr153274/after-1.json), [run 2](pr153274/after-2.json), and
[run 3](pr153274/after-3.json). Adjacent `.native.json` files record the bounded
observations. Each successful scan retained exact source-attribution notices.

A separate disposable commit changed one ASCII byte of the fixture password,
with the path, mode, and test structure otherwise unchanged. The canonical native
scan [refused that mutation](pr153274/negative-one-byte.json) with
`findings / literal_not_reviewed`; that local proof commit is not a published
OpenClaw change. The focused scanner/fixture suite passes 365 tests, including
new real-Git added, removed, and context-line cases for both observed decoders
and refusal controls for literal, full-line, path, mode, role, verified status,
unqualified decoder, and an additional occurrence.

Limits: no model runs and no hosted review is replaced. Hosted ClawSweeper must
rescan its own current prompt, schema, and complete source inputs after the
normal policy landing. Existing scanner, verification, completion, source,
mode, and patch-provenance gates remain enabled. OpenClaw Bay is unaffected: no
dashboard API, telemetry schema, or public action surface changes.

## Browser CDP discovery fixture

Claim: the approved synthetic credentialed-CDP discovery fixture in
`extensions/browser/src/browser/pw-session.connections.test.ts` admits through
exact source attribution; a one-byte mutation still refuses. This unblocks
[OpenClaw PR 153597](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/153597), whose
browser changes retain the existing fixture unchanged.

[Identity evidence](browser-session/identities.json) records the two observed
URI detector 17 tuples, for `PLAIN` and `HTML`. Each binds both native value
digests, the complete source line,
original path, regular-file mode, and committed base/head references. The
scanner's verification and complete-input admission checks stay enabled.

The controlled proof runs the actual `scanAgentInput` entry point with pinned
TruffleHog 3.97.4 against the complete committed PR range on macOS arm64,
Node 26.8.2, and pnpm 12.4.1. Provider: local host; no image or lease.

```bash
pnpm run build:node
node docs/proof/agent-input-scan-context/run-proof.mjs \
  /path/to/disposable/openclaw-at-pr-head \
  ca128370df1057f5d1169e5918dfe551ac212a81 \
  2d674c57c1d9e5e174c0cecc6961763cf4230157 \
  /path/to/browser-session-admission.json
```

[Before qualification](browser-session/before.json), ClawSweeper main
`20e7ed8e9aab5e58217708f4aebe89d3af157b8f` refused with
`findings / literal_not_reviewed`. [After qualification](browser-session/after-1.json),
the identical range admitted in 6.4 seconds, classifying the browser fixture at
both endpoints and the separately approved browser documentation fixture. This
run observed PLAIN; the earlier native fixture scan observed HTML as well.

A disposable commit changed exactly one byte of the fixture, preserving the
path and mode. The same canonical scan [refused it](browser-session/negative.json)
with `findings / literal_not_reviewed`.
[The negative-control record](browser-session/negative-control.json) binds its
original and changed blobs and line digests; the mutation was not published.

The regression suite uses real Git-generated added, removed, and context lines
for both qualified decoders. Negative controls cover changed values, full lines,
paths, modes, uncommitted roles, verified findings, other decoders, and extra
occurrences. The three positive browser cases fail on the unqualified policy.

Limits: no model runs. Hosted review must rescan its own complete prompt, schema,
and source inputs. OpenClaw Bay is unaffected; there is no dashboard API,
telemetry, or public action surface change.

## TypeSafe local transport fixture

Claim: the approved synthetic loopback credential-rejection fixture in
`extensions/typesafe/src/local.transport.test.ts` admits through exact source
attribution, while a one-byte mutation still refuses. This unblocks the
input scan for [OpenClaw PR 154059](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/154059).
It adds no model-side instructions or scanning bypass.

[Native identity evidence](typesafe/native-observed.json) records URI detector 17,
both observed `PLAIN` and `HTML` decoders, and the exact Raw/RawV2 digests.
The policy also pins the complete source line, original path, regular-file mode,
and committed base/head witnesses. No other fixture in the file is qualified.

The actual `scanAgentInput` entry point scanned the complete committed range
with pinned TruffleHog 3.97.4 and enabled verification on macOS arm64,
Node 26.8.2, pnpm 12.4.1 (local host, no container or lease):

```bash
pnpm run build:node
node docs/proof/agent-input-scan-context/run-proof.mjs \
  /path/to/disposable/openclaw-at-pr-head \
  7d14778dc23424b7763f4e47e87aca2b63d6b363 \
  3ee5b1050b7f94ba65dc596ef13188b6ea7a602f \
  /path/to/typesafe-admission.json
```

[Before qualification](typesafe/before.json), ClawSweeper
`a09e6cefb31adcd12bba10e1658cae5fced08c80` refused with
`findings / literal_not_reviewed`. [After qualification](typesafe/after.json),
the same range admitted in 2.24 seconds, with independently attributed source
and added-patch findings. A disposable commit changed one byte in the fixture;
[that control](typesafe/negative-control.json) was [refused](typesafe/negative.json).
The control commit is not published.

The shared real-Git fixture suite covers added, removed, and context lines plus
changed literal, line, path, mode, role, verification status, decoder, and extra
occurrence refusals. Scanner completion and verification checks remain unchanged.
No model runs in this proof; hosted review must rescan its current prompt, schema,
and complete source inputs. OpenClaw Bay is unaffected: no dashboard API,
telemetry, or public action surface changes.

## Gateway question rejection fixture

This historical proof qualifies the Gateway sibling of the UI question fixture,
introduced by the same OpenClaw commit
`a37eb17fdfd688e0ed7e7be31950381cf15fb9bd`. Its bytes and source path differ,
so the existing UI qualification correctly refused it. The Gateway test rejects
a synthetic credentialed URL on the reserved `example.test` domain before
publishing a question, with no manager entry or broadcast. The fixture is unchanged.

OpenClaw PR [155339](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/155339) at
`0688c464ba61caff8492d4d0f95ed7c27e7eecac` was refused by hosted review
[35678098402](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/35678098402):
URI detector 17, HTML decoder, unverified. The complete committed range from
`2c23442435e829a868fbc69f9e26ab747a4fd7fa` reproduced two findings locally: the
same exact fixture in base and head blobs, reported through PLAIN. Both decoder
rows bind exact Raw/RawV2 identities, complete line bytes, regular-file mode,
and `src/gateway/server-methods/question.test.ts`; scanner verification, source
references, and patch/hunk validation remain unchanged.

On Linux x64 with Node 24.20.0 and pinned TruffleHog 3.97.4, the existing
`run-proof.mjs` command above, using these base/head arguments, changed from
refusal in 3.268 seconds to admission in 2.236 seconds. A disposable committed
clone replacing one indentation space with a tab on line 338 still refused in
2.228 seconds, while retaining the URI bytes. The public classifier tests cover
both decoders and real Git-generated added, removed, and context attribution,
plus changed literal, line, path, mode, role, decoder, verification, and occurrence.

[The sanitized receipt](question-gateway/proof.json) preserves source identities,
native hashes, and results. A separate one-byte username mutation was not emitted
by the native detector; its admission is recorded as a detection limitation, not
negative proof. The changed-literal classifier regression still rejects emitted
mutations. This proof uses a controlled prompt, runs no model, and does not replace
the hosted review's own complete prompt/schema/source scan. OpenClaw Bay remains
unaffected: no dashboard, queue, publication, or observer contract changes.

## Session Share rejected userinfo links

OpenClaw [PR 156736](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/156736) adds
receiver-origin and sidebar-link rejection cases on the reserved
`team.example.com` domain. Both use generic placeholder userinfo solely to
assert rejection. The source tests and their meaningful negative coverage remain
unchanged.

The complete committed range refused in hosted
[run 35911889455](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/35911889455)
is reproduced by the existing proof command using base
`bc6fedbe4633d3ccc0e4bb84ef323fa62794c6fd` and head
`6a6946b800f21a8f6b09f0bb7426b9c35ff32422`. Its merge base is
`0052923d044f0e44664c9b2d352e0db84525dc14`.

[The pre-qualification receipt](session-share/before.json) records refusal.
[Sanitized native evidence](session-share/before.native.json) accounts for all
four reproduced findings: the receiver test line 118 in the committed blob and added patch
(PLAIN), and the sidebar test line 13 in its committed blob (HTML) and added
patch (PLAIN). Hosted diagnostics retain only the first finding; the other
identities here come from complete-range native reproduction, not omitted hosted
records. Each retains detector/decoder, Raw/RawV2 digests, full-line digest,
canonical source path, regular-file mode, and committed source identity. Native
location metadata is resolved against the exact blob or canonical generated
patch line; no raw credential-shaped values are retained.

The four host-owned rows qualify only those observed identities and decoders,
including the receiver URI's exact shared-prefix occurrence in the sidebar line.
The first full-range proof correctly [refused that missing witness](session-share/before-shared-prefix.json)
until its complete sidebar line was separately qualified; the classifier's
all-occurrences requirement is unchanged. The regression suite includes this
shorter native identity in the full sidebar source line.
The real-Git regression harness covers additions, removals, and unchanged
context, and refuses changed literal bytes, whole lines, source paths, modes,
roles, source revisions, verified findings, unsupported decoders, and additional
occurrences. At that first qualification, the receiver's unobserved HTML decoder remained refused. Scanner
execution, verification, source freshness, and patch validation remain enabled.

Native detector results can vary: another observation of the same range emitted
only the two sidebar findings. A missing native finding is not negative proof.
Classifier mutations supply deterministic refusal coverage; native complete-range
admission still does not replace hosted review's prompt/schema/source scan.
OpenClaw Bay is unaffected: no dashboard, queue, or publication behavior changes.

On Linux x64, Node 26.7.0, and pinned TruffleHog 3.97.4
([runtime identity](session-share/runtime.json)), the same original complete range
[admits after qualification](session-share/after-original.json) in 3.994 seconds,
including the receiver's shared-prefix patch witness. The parent-confirmed final
OpenClaw head `26c03d2466f7b95e3c77da9912377e115d65f24d` also
[admits](session-share/after-final.json) in 3.890 seconds using the same base.
[Its native observation](session-share/after-final.native.json) reports two
sidebar findings; this is complete-range admission, not a claim that every
native detector emits every synthetic value on every run. The
[final source identities](session-share/final-identities.json) verify both exact
qualified lines unchanged (receiver line 124, sidebar line 13). No model ran.

### Session Share HTML follow-up: complete-material proof

[Hosted run 35921576228](https://github.com/openclaw/clawsweeper/actions/runs/35921576228)
used policy `6500b62dfd4c4efb0e2b821c1e9c427e128febef` and refused URI detector
17, HTML, unverified at receiver blob `b018d18acd4686a7dafa1899c4f20653c06ee42c`,
line 124. The source head and base were unchanged from the final proof above.
The diagnostic retained finding 3 of 4, but no raw-value digests, other finding
records, or original prompt. No model ran and no unchanged hosted retry followed.

Before changing policy, a representative full-input scan on that same policy
[reproduced the exact diagnostic](session-share-html/before.json). It used the
host review template, captured PR metadata and discussion through
`serializeReviewContext`, the actual decision schema, and the complete committed
range. All four reproduced native records are accounted for:

| Material                          | Native line | Decoder | Identity |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ------- | -------- |
| Complete patch, receiver addition | 537         | PLAIN   | Receiver |
| Sidebar committed blob            | 13          | HTML    | Sidebar  |
| Complete patch, sidebar addition  | 1378        | HTML    | Sidebar  |
| Receiver committed blob           | 124         | HTML    | Receiver |

[Full identity receipts](session-share-html/identities.json) retain detector,
decoder, unverified state, Raw/RawV2 digests, exact source line/path/ref/mode, and
all literal source witnesses. Both identities are existing generic userinfo
rejection fixtures on the reserved `team.example.com` domain. The first three
records are reproduced evidence, **not recovered hosted records**. The receiver
HTML record matches every retained hosted field, including index/count. The
original hosted prompt and first three exact identities remain unavailable.

The two new attribution tuples qualify only the observed receiver HTML identity
at its exact receiver line and the same identity's exact shared-prefix witness
in the sidebar line. The latter is required when that receiver finding occurs
in the complete patch containing both files. It is a source witness, not a claim
that the scanner emitted a separate shorter sidebar URI. There is no new
value-only exemption or classifier algorithm change.

Why did the earlier local proof pass? The
[identical-input comparison](session-share-html/same-input-variability.json)
shows two scans with the same binary, arguments, prompt hash, and complete staged
manifest: four findings/refusal, then only two sidebar findings/admission, **both
before qualification**. Pinned TruffleHog 3.97.4 recognizes TypeScript generics in
the receiver blob as HTML-like input. Its concurrent engine deduplicates identical
Raw/RawV2/source metadata without including the decoder in the key; its URI
detector also skips later candidates after caching DNS `IsNotFound` for that
host. These verified mechanisms explain the observed subset/decoder variability;
per-run scheduling and DNS traces were not retained. A missing finding is not
negative proof. The prompt/schema difference is a proof gap, not established
cause of HTML decoding in a separately staged blob.

The prior controlled proof omitted the hosted schema and used a short prompt.
The existing runner now accepts optional prompt and schema files and records
their hashes without publishing their contents:

```bash
node docs/proof/agent-input-scan-context/run-proof.mjs \
  /path/to/openclaw-at-pr-head \
  bc6fedbe4633d3ccc0e4bb84ef323fa62794c6fd \
  26c03d2466f7b95e3c77da9912377e115d65f24d \
  /path/to/admission.json \
  /path/to/representative-review-prompt.txt \
  schema/clawsweeper-decision.schema.json
```

The deterministic regression builds a real two-file Git range and supplies its
full patch, raw metadata, both endpoint blobs, prompt, and schema together. It
always exercises both observed decoders and the cross-file shared-prefix witness,
independently of native sampling. The existing adversarial cases cover changed
literal, complete line, path, mode, role, revision, verified state, unsupported
decoder, and extra occurrence; the full-material case also refuses an altered
sidebar witness. Scanner and verification remain enabled.

The [post-qualification native receipt](session-share-html/after.json) uses the
same complete representative input. No model execution, deployment, OpenClaw
source edit, or hosted-review replacement is claimed. The exact original hosted
prompt was not retained; this is representative full-input proof, not its
byte-for-byte recovery. OpenClaw Bay is unaffected: no dashboard, queue,
publication, telemetry schema, or public action surface changes.
