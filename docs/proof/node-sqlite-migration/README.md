# Node SQLite migration proof

## Claim

The five gitcrawl SQLite query subprocesses now use Node 24's synchronous
`node:sqlite` API in read-only mode without changing their parsed row, scalar,
empty-result, or caller-level error contracts. The cluster-intake workflow no
longer installs the obsolete `sqlite3` executable.

## Host equivalence

`run-proof.mjs` creates a real portable gitcrawl database with committed rows
still resident in its WAL sidecar. It extracts the three old source files from
`origin/main`, verifies their five old `sqlite3` invocations, and executes the
same scalar and JSON queries through the host `sqlite3` CLI and the new
`node:sqlite` helper. Their parsed JSON bytes and scalar text must be identical.

Run after `pnpm run build:all`:

```sh
node docs/proof/node-sqlite-migration/run-proof.mjs
```

The machine-readable result is `equivalence.json`.

## Contract decisions

JSON query rows intentionally remain ordinary JavaScript objects containing
numbers. Statements read SQLite integers as BigInts and explicitly normalize
them with `Number()`, matching the old `sqlite3 -json` plus `JSON.parse` path,
including its precision loss above `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`. Scalar queries
retain exact decimal text; their existing callers continue to apply `Number()`.

Every query opens `DatabaseSync(dbPath, { readOnly: true })`, so committed WAL
rows remain visible while a missing database is no longer created as a side
effect. Related-context still catches query failures: a missing configured path
returns `[]`/`false` before a query, and a corrupt store returns `[]`/`null`.
Both importer entry points still fail nonzero for missing or corrupt stores.

## Container and gates

The seven local gates passed on Node 24.19.0 and pnpm 11.10.0:

1. Host old/new equivalence proof: three scalar and three JSON query cases,
   including missing/corrupt error evidence.
2. Focused real-database fixtures: 6 passed, 0 failed.
3. `pnpm run build:all`: all three TypeScript projects passed.
4. `pnpm run test:no-build`: 3,333 tests; 3,324 passed, 9 skipped, 0 failed.
5. `pnpm run lint`: all four lint lanes passed.
6. `pnpm run format:check`: 663 files passed.
7. `pnpm run check:static`: active-surface, dashboard boundary, docs, limits,
   and format checks passed.

The committed `container-proof.sh` requires a fresh PR checkout whose image has
no `sqlite3` binary. It installs the repository's pinned pnpm through Corepack,
downloads jq 1.8.1, verifies the selected jq binary against the official
published checksum, runs the focused real-database fixtures through only the
new path, and then runs the full `pnpm check` gate.

Container provenance and secret-scanned stdout are committed alongside this
proof after the required `--fresh-pr` run. Crabbox resolved `provider=aws` and
ran pushed head `31386dccd6ee9f77fe480ab6c705253647f4aaf2` in lease
`cbx_3ddd8eadc1bb` (`amber-barnacle-28b5`), run `run_61e78be4ed53`. The
`node:24-bookworm` command exited 0 after 187,543 ms: all 6 focused fixtures
passed, then full `pnpm check` passed 3,333 tests with 3,325 passed, 8 skipped,
and 0 failed at 81.60% line, 74.06% branch, and 87.40% function coverage.
`sqlite3` was absent before and after the rsync-only system dependency setup.

The full 571,547-byte stdout capture has SHA-256
`28669d632e2d5387d901c76504611ab37a19bd23de0c29453767e2bf5efe5c76`.
TruffleHog 3.96.0 scanned that exact file with zero verified or unverified
secrets; `container-stdout.log` retains the proof-bearing stdout lines. Full
machine-readable details, including the three discarded harness attempts, are
in `container-provenance.json` and `container-secret-scan.json`.

The run's project-local Crabbox 0.38.3-5 wrapper timed out while releasing the
otherwise successful lease. Crabbox 0.41.1 then explicitly released
`cbx_3ddd8eadc1bb`; a provider-specific lease listing returned empty.

## Limits and Bay impact

Fixtures are disposable local files; no proof command contacts Gitcrawl,
GitHub APIs, Worker storage, or another production service. The host needs
`sqlite3` only for old-path equivalence. The container intentionally cannot run
the old path because the binary is absent.

OpenClaw Bay is unaffected. This changes local read-only store access and one
workflow bootstrap step, not lifecycle publication, queue control, status
telemetry, dashboard data, or Bay's observer-only boundary.
