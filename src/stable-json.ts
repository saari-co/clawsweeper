/**
 * Canonical JSON for content digests and equality checks.
 *
 * Keys are ordered by UTF-16 code unit, never by locale collation.
 * `String.prototype.localeCompare` is unusable here for two reasons:
 *
 *   1. It is not a strict total order. Collation-ignorable characters (zero-width
 *      joiner, soft hyphen, most control characters) make distinct keys compare
 *      equal, and `Array.prototype.sort` is stable, so a tie leaves the keys in
 *      property-insertion order. Two objects with the same key/value set then
 *      serialize differently and hash differently.
 *   2. It is locale and ICU dependent. With no locale argument it follows the
 *      runtime default, and collation tables differ between locales and ICU
 *      releases - `cs-CZ`, for example, orders `ch` after `h`, which reorders
 *      keys such as `changedFiles` and `checksDigest`. A digest computed on one
 *      runner would then not match the same input on another.
 *
 * `stableJsonCodeUnit` / `sortStableCodeUnit` are retained as explicit aliases;
 * they are equivalent to the unsuffixed pair.
 *
 * One caveat: array-index-like keys ("0", "2", "10") are not emitted in code-unit
 * order. `Object.fromEntries` rebuilds the object and the engine re-applies its
 * own ascending-numeric ordering for those keys, which this comparator cannot
 * override. That ordering is specified by ECMAScript and is locale independent,
 * so the output stays canonical - it simply is not purely byte-ordered. Callers
 * needing byte order for numeric keys should serialize them directly, as
 * `actionLedgerJson` does.
